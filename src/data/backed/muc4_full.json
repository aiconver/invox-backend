ATTENTION: THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT HAS SUSPENDED ITS AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.     SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTER LUIS YANEZ [AS HEARD] REPORTED TODAY THAT SPAIN HAS SUSPENDED AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT UNTIL THE KILLINGS OF THE SPANISH JESUITS, WHO HAD BEEN LIVING IN OUR COUNTRY FOR YEARS, ARE RESOLVED.     THIS REPORT REPRESENTS A SERIOUS POLITICAL SETBACK FOR THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.  THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S DECISION FURTHER ISOLATES THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WHICH IS ALREADY UNDER PRESSURE BECAUSE OF CALLS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SUSPENSION OF MILITARY AID.  THIS SUSPENSION REPRESENTS A HALT IN THE DELIVERY OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT TO SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.     THIS REPRESENTS INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.  THE INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION OF THE CRISTIANI REGIME IS GROWING.",

SHE HAS DESCRIBED U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CASOLO AS AN ERP [PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY] MEMBER IN CHARGE OF LOGISTICS.     AS HAS BEEN REPORTED, CASOLO WAS RELEASED BY A MILITARY JUDGE AFTER HE DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE AGAINST HER.  SOME GROUPS, HOWEVER, ASSERT THAT CASOLO WAS RELEASED DUE TO POLITICAL PRESSURE FROM THE UNITED STATES, WHICH THREATENED TO LAUNCH A WORLDWIDE CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT EL SALVADOR IF CASOLO WAS NOT RELEASED.     AGUILAR MARROQUIN WAS ARRESTED AT 1500 ON 9 DECEMBER AFTER HAVING PARTICIPATED IN AN ATTACK ON AN URBAN PUBLIC BUS NEAR JUAN PABLO II BOULEVARD.     THE WOMAN FLED AND SOUGHT REFUGE INSIDE THE FACILITIES OF THE SALVADORAN ALBERTO MASFERRER UNIVERSITY, WHERE SHE TOOK A GROUP OF STUDENTS AS HOSTAGES, THREATENING THEM WITH HAND GRENADES. THE POLICE PREVENTED HER FROM DOING ANYTHING AND ARRESTED HER, CONFISCATING ONE .45-CALIBER PISTOL, BULLETS, CARTRIDGES, AND TWO FRAGMENTATION GRENADES.     AGUILAR MARROQUIN SAID THAT SHE JOINED THE ERP LAST MARCH AND THAT SHE WAS PART OF AN URBAN COMMANDO CALLED WORKERS JUSTICE COMMAND. AGUILAR ADDED THAT SHE KNOWS U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CASOLO, WHO BELONGS TO THE ERP, AND THAT CASOLO USED TO MEET WITH TERRORIST LEADER FERNANDO, WORKERS JUSTICE COMMAND OPERATIONS CHIEF, NEAR THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY (UES).     AGUILAR ADDED THAT CASOLO WAS IN CHARGE OF ERP LOGISTICS, ESPECIALLY LODGING PEOPLE AND TRANSPORTING ARMS AND WAR EQUIPMENT. THE ERP HAD GIVEN HER TWO MINIBUSES FOR HER TO CARRY OUT HER TASKS.     IN ADDITION, AGUILAR SAID THAT SHE BELIEVES CASOLO HAD A LEADING POSITION WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION, BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO MEETING WITH FERNANDO, SHE ALSO MET WITH AN INDIVIDUAL KNOWN AS MINCHO, WHO IS THE POLITICAL-MILITARY ERP METROPOLITAN CHIEF AND ALSO THE CHIEF OF THE SO-CALLED URBAN COMMANDOS.     THE PRISONER KNEW ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE ARMS IN CASOLO'S HOUSE, BECAUSE ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS AGUILAR'S CHIEF, KNOWN AS MIRIAM, TOLD HER ABOUT IT. OTHER TERRORISTS WENT TO CASOLO'S HOUSE TO GET WEAPONS, AMMUNITION, AND EXPLOSIVES TO CONDUCT THEIR SABOTAGE OPERATIONS AGAINST BUSES, TELEPHONE DISTRIBUTION BOXES, POWER PYLONS, OR TO CONDUCT LARGE OPERATIONS--AS AGUILAR DESCRIBED THEM-- SUCH AS ATTACKS ON MILITARY GARRISONS.     ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION OBTAINED, THE PRISONER WILL BE SENT TO COURT OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.",

I THEREFORE WANTED TO CONVEY A MESSAGE OF HOPE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO EVERY CHILEAN, TO SHOW THEM MY FEELINGS AT THIS TIME OF DEEP REFLECTION.     FROM THE VERY MOMENT I LEARNED ABOUT THIS TERRORIST ECONOMIC AGGRESSION, I ORDERED THE CREATION OF FOUR MINISTERIAL COMMISSIONS TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM. I ALSO SENT TWO MINISTERS TO THE UNITED STATES TO MEET WITH U.S.  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. AFTER TIRING SESSIONS OF TALKS, THESE MINISTERS MANAGED TO OVERCOME A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE GRAPE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM AFFECTING OTHER FRUITS REMAINS TO BE SOLVED.     THIS NEW ATTACK AGAINST THE CHILEAN NATION, AN ATTACK THAT DESTINY HAS PLACED IN THE NATION'S PATH OF FREEDOM, PROGRESS, AND WELL-BEING, COMPELS US TO CLOSE RANKS BEHIND THE GOVERNMENT, UNIFIED AND READY TO FIGHT -- WITH COURAGE AND HIGH SPIRIT -- THE PROBLEM THAT FACES US.     ON THIS OCCASION THE COUNTRY HAS SEEN HOW THE COUNTLESS THREATS TO BOYCOTT THE NATIONAL ECONOMY HAVE WORKED. MOST OF THE TIME SUCH THREATS HAVE BEEN PROMOTED BY CERTAIN POLITICIANS, LABOR LEADERS, OR COMMUNIST LABOR UNIONS, BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO -- DRIVEN BY PERSONAL OR IDEOLOGICAL INTEREST -- HAVE CONTINUALLY JEOPARDIZED THE STABILITY OF WORKERS, OF FAMILIES, AND OF THOSE WHOM THEY DEMAGOGICALLY CALL THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN. THEY DO NOT CARE IF THEY CAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT, POVERTY, AND HUNGER TO 500,000 FELLOW CITIZENS WHO WORK IN THIS AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY.     HOW SHAMELESSLY THEY MAKE CLAIMS AND DEMANDS, OFFERING THEIR SUPPORT AND THEIR SOLIDARITY WHEN CHILE IS SERIOUSLY THREATENED! YET WHEN THE DANGER IS OVER, THEY CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE AND AGAIN LEVEL CHARGES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND CRITICIZE ITS ACTIONS. IN DOING THAT THEY FAIL TO RECALL THAT FROM ITS VERY BEGINNING THE CHILEAN NATION HAS BEEN BUILT UPON NON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ESSENCE OF THE NATIONAL SOUL.     GENTLEMEN: OUR WILL IS BASED ON OUR FEELING OF UNITY IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY, WHETHER FROM THE ACTION OF NATURE OR FROM THE ACTION OF TREACHEROUS, DISTURBED MINDS THAT RECOGNIZE NO MORAL VALUES, FATHERLAND, OR LAW.     CHILEANS: A FEW DAYS AGO I REPORTED ON THE STEPS FORWARD IN THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION PROCESS AND ON THE PROGRESS THAT OUR COUNTRY HAS MADE IN ALL FIELDS.     THE FACT THAT CYANIDE HAS BEEN INJECTED INTO TWO EXPORTED GRAPES HAS CAUSED INCALCULABLE DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY; IT HAS ALSO BROUGHT THE SHADOW OF ANGUISH AND UNCERTAINTY TO THOUSANDS OF HOMES OF FELLOW COUNTRYMEN WHOSE JOBS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO A LIVELIHOOD HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY JEOPARDIZED. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT SOME OFFICIALS OF IMPORTING COUNTRIES, WITHOUT WEIGHING THE TRUE EFFECTS OF THIS TYPE OF MEASURE, HAVE RESTRICTED THE IMPORT OF CHILEAN FRUITS, THUS PROVOKING FEAR AND DISTRUST ON THE INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER MARKET. GENTLEMEN, WE MUST REVERSE THIS SITUATION.     WE SHOULD ONCE AGAIN ACT IN A UNITED MANNER TO RECOVER INTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE AND OUR UNDISPUTED LEADERSHIP AS EXPORTERS. I AM SURE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED WITH A NEW JOINT EFFORT. [CONTINUED]",

    "doctext": "SAN SALVADOR, 22 APR 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] DEAR RADIO AUDIENCE: FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TALK TO YOU TONIGHT ABOUT A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY.  MANY TIMES YOU HAVE HEARD US MENTION THE WORD SOLIDARITY.  WE HAVE ALWAYS USED IT AS A WORD THAT MEANS TO THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO SUFFER THE MOST, THOSE WHO HAVE LESS.  INDEED, THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE MUST HELP, EVEN WITH OUR OWN SACRIFICE, AND MANY TIMES WITH A HUGE SACRIFICE BY ALL OF US.  IF LOVE IS THE BOND THAT UNITES FAMILY MEMBERS, SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE GREAT PILLAR, THE CEMENT THAT UNITES SALVADORAN SOCIETY, SO THAT, UNITED, WE MAY FULFILL OUR DESIRE FOR PEACE, TRANQUILITY, HAPPINESS, AND WELL-BEING.     HOWEVER, TONIGHT ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE CONSIDER SHOULD BE THE USE OF THE WORD SOLIDARITY AND WHAT THIS WORD MEANS IN MATTERS THAT ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER.  A FEW WEEKS AGO THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OIL PRICES, TO RAISE THE PRICE OF OIL BYPRODUCTS SUCH AS GASOLINE, DIESEL, AND ALL FUELS.  IN THE PAST, THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE. PERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT DID THIS TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS WOULD HAVE NOTHING BUT POSITIVE EFFECTS.  HOWEVER, LET US ANALYZE FOR A WHILE THE ISSUE OF INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF FUEL.  WHEN A GOVERNMENT HAS NO MONEY FOR SUBSIDIZING, THAT MEANS THE COST OF LIVING WILL GO UP. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT PRICES WILL RISE WHEN A GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE THAN WHAT IT HAS.  HOWEVER, LET US SEE HOW THIS ASPECT, OR RATHER THE PRINCIPLE OF SOLIDARITY, APPLIES TO THE INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES, ESPECIALLY THE PRICE OF GASOLINE.     TEN PERCENT OF ALL FAMILIES IN OUR COUNTRY OWN A VEHICLE.  IN GENERAL, THAT 10 PERCENT ARE THOSE WHO HAVE THE MOST; IN OTHER WORDS, THOSE WHO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF BUYING A CAR, A VEHICLE.  IF WE SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE, WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING IS TAKING MONEY OUT OF A GOVERNMENT THAT, FOR THE TIME BEING, DOES NOT HAVE SUCH FUNDS AVAILABLE.  IN ORDER TO GET SUCH FUNDS, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO IMPOSE NEW TAXES WHICH WOULD AFFECT ALL SALVADORANS.  THEREFORE, LET US THINK WHETHER OR NOT IT IS FAIR THAT 90 PERCENT OF ALL SALVADORAN FAMILIES, WHO OWN NO VEHICLES, MUST PAY SOME KIND OF TAX IN ORDER TO BENEFIT THE OTHER 10 PERCENT WHO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT ALLOW THEM TO BUY A VEHICLE.     WE DO NOT WANT TO APPEAR AS DEMAGOGIC OR POPULIST WITH THIS EXAMPLE.  WHAT WE WANT TO SAY IS THAT THOSE OF US WHO OWN A VEHICLE, WHO ARE PART OF THE 10 PERCENT LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SOMETHING AND THUS CAN BUY A VEHICLE, MUST BE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THAT 90 PERCENT WHO HAVE LITTLE AND MANY TIMES NOTHING.  THEY HAVE NO VEHICLES, AND THEREFORE HAVE NO REASON TO SUFFER SO THE GASOLINE WE BUY BECOMES CHEAPER. MOREOVER, TO SOME EXTENT THE CURRENT PRICE OF GASOLINE MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR THE DIESEL SUPPLIED TO URBAN AND INTERURBAN BUS COMPANIES TO BE BOUGHT AT A PRICE THAT WILL ALLOW BUS OWNERS TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT BUS FARES.  THIS IS SOLIDARITY, AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT. THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOMETHING, WHO OWN A VEHICLE, PAY SOMETHING -- THROUGH THE PRICE OF THE GASOLINE WE CONSUME -- SO THAT THOSE WHO OWN NOTHING AND MUST USE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION BUSES CAN DO SO WITH NO PRICE INCREASE.     THE SAME SHOULD BE THE CASE FOR THE COST OF LIQUID GAS AND PROPANE GAS, SO THAT THE PRICES OF FOOD COOKED WITH GAS IN THE MARKETPLACES ARE NOT INCREASED.  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOMETHING CAN SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE LITTLE OR NOTHING AT ALL.     I WOULD NOW LIKE TO TALK ABOUT AN EXAMPLE OF AN EVEN DEEPER KIND OF SOLIDARITY.  I WANT TO TALK ABOUT PEACE.  SALVADORAN BROTHERS, THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE MOTHERS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR SONS.  WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THE INNOCENT CHILDREN WHO COULD KICK A MINE AND END UP WITHOUT AN ARM OR A LEG.  WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO, BECAUSE OF VIOLENCE, CANNOT FIND A JOB.  THAT IS WHY THIS IS THE TIME FOR ALL OF US TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO ACHIEVE PEACE.     LAST THURSDAY I TOLD YOU I FELT MORE OPTIMISTIC AFTER MEETING WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND LISTENING TO THEIR DECISION TO ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE TO WORK FOR PEACE.  THEY ARE DETERMINED TO REACH A CONSENSUS TO FULFILL THE ASPIRATIONS OF ALL SALVADORANS.  WE ARE BEGINNING TO SENSE WHAT THE NEAR FUTURE OF EL SALVADOR COULD BE.  WE ARE FEELING HAPPY AND OPTIMISTIC.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT, THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE SHOULD ALL CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE.     ANYTHING THAT MAY LEAD TO VIOLENCE, WHETHER IT IS STREET DISTURBANCES OR BOMBS, SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED, BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER CONCEIVABLE FOR MOTHERS, CHILDREN, AND FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TO SUFFER IN OUR COUNTRY.  THE TIME HAS COME TO SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY, TO SEARCH, NOT ONLY THROUGH WORDS BUT ALSO THROUGH OUR EXAMPLES AND ACTIONS, FOR THE PEACE THAT OUR COUNTRY AND SALVADORANS DESERVE.     THEREFORE, OUR SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR OUR COUNTRY'S RECONSTRUCTION.  IT SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR THE PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL RECONSTRUCTION OF ALL SALVADORANS.  WE WANT ALL SALVADORANS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, TO SUPPORT THE PEACE EFFORTS, SO THAT THOSE WHO SUFFER SO VERY MUCH FROM VIOLENCE WILL NO LONGER SUFFER.     THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL STEP FORWARD FOR THE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  SALVADORAN BROTHERS, LET US SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY IN THIS CRUCIAL TIME IN OUR HISTORY, BECAUSE WE HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT WHEN ALL SALVADORANS ACT POSITIVELY LIKE BROTHERS, WE CAN COME OUT AHEAD.  THIS IS ALL FOR TONIGHT.  THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU.",

THE BLAST FROM THE EXPLOSION HIT A TRUCK FULL OF POLICEMEN, WHO HAD EARLIER CARRIED OUT AN ANTI-MAFIA OPERATION IN A PEASANT VILLAGE, AS WELL AS SEVERAL PUBLIC BUSES, HOUSES, AND BUSINESSES.     A POLICE EXPERT SAID THAT THE CAR BOMB (CONTAINING 300 KG OF DYNAMITE) WAS ACTIVATED BY REMOTE CONTROL AS THE ELITE FORCE PATROL PASSED BY.     ACCORDING TO GOMEZ MARTINEZ, \"THESE ACTIONS WILL ONLY CEASE WHEN (PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS') GOVERNMENT PUTS ASIDE SO MUCH PREJUDICE AND AGREES TO THE PEACE TALKS,\" PROPOSED BY THE SUBVERSIVES.     \"THE DIALOGUE WILL TAKE PLACE SONNER OR LATER, AND IT IS BETTER TO START NOW,\" INSISTED THE MAYOR OF MEDELLIN, A CITY WHERE THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL CARTEL HAS ITS BASE OF OPERATIONS.     THE CHIEF OF THE CRIMINAL GANG, PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, ORDERED THE ASSASSINATION OF MEDELLIN POLICEMEN IN RETALIATION FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTION AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  TWENTY-EIGHT POLICEMEN HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THIS CITY OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS.     ACCORDING TO SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS, YESTERDAY'S ATTACK \"COULD BE ESCOBAR GAVIRIA'S RESPONSE TO THE ARREST OF ADOLFO MESA MENESES,\" HIS RIGHT-HAND MAN.     MESA MENESES WAS ARRESTED LAST WEEK BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS, SECRET POLICE), AND THE AUTHORITIES HAVE ACCUSED HIM OF ASSASSINATING -- ON ORDERS FROM THE MAFIA LEADER -- LEFTIST PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, AS WELL AS A CHIEF OF POLICE, A MAYOR, AND SEVERAL JOURNALISTS.     MEANWHILE, HUNDREDS OF SOLDIERS, POLICEMEN, AND DETECTIVES ARE CARRYING OUT LARGE-SCALE OPERATIONS IN THE COLOMBIAN COUNTRYSIDE AND BORDER AREAS ON THE SUSPICION THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA PLANS TO FLEE THE COUNTRY.     LAST NIGHT, A TELEVISION NEWSCAST SHOWED PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE \"DRUG LORD\" THAT HAD BEEN \"RECENTLY\" TAKEN BY SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS AT A COLOMBIAN BEACH ON THE PACIFIC COAST.     A POLICE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN CONFIRMED TODAY THAT \"WE HAVE RELIABLE INFORMATION ON HIS WHEREABOUTS,\" ALTHOUGH HE REFRAINED FROM GIVING FURTHER DETAILS.  UNOFFICIAL SOURCES SAID THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA \"IS SOMEWHERE IN WESTERN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT\" -- OF WHICH MEDELLIN IS THE CAPITAL -- WHERE THE SEARCH OPERATIONS ARE CONCENTRATED.     COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO ASKED FOR THE COOPERATION OF BRAZIL, ECUADOR, PANAMA, PERU, AND VENEZUELA TO STOP THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS FROM ESCAPING TO THOSE COUNTRIES.",

LAST NIGHT WE REPORTED THAT THE ARCH OF LIBERTY EXISTS IN THE CAPITAL; IT IS COMPRISED OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND HOUSING PROJECTS -- WHERE THE PROTAGONISTS OF THIS HISTORY ARE THE MASSES, WHICH ARE ORGANIZED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF TRENCHES AND BARRICADES.  THE PEOPLE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PROTAGONISTS IN THIS HISTORIC ACTION.     RADIO VENCEREMOS URGES THE PEOPLE TO MULTIPLY THEIR ORGANIZATION IN EACH NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN.  POPULAR COMMITTEES MUST BE ORGANIZED; THE PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE THEMSELVES; BUT IF THE ENEMY IS NEAR, THIS MUST BE DONE CLANDESTINELY.  ALL THE GROUPS IN EACH TOWN, MEANING THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS, STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS, TEACHERS ORGANIZATIONS, AND COOPERATIVES, MUST ALL ORGANIZE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR POLITICAL BELIEFS.  OUR UNITY MUST BECOME THE BEST TOOL TO EVICT, ONCE AND FOR ALL, THE MURDEROUS MILITARY DICTATORSHIP WHICH ASSASSINATES PRIESTS AND WHICH BOMBED THE CAPITAL AGAIN EARLY THIS MORNING.  IT HAS AGAIN CAUSED MORE DEATHS AND WOUNDED IN SAN SALVADOR.     IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE TO ORGANIZE COMMITTEES IN EACH NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN, AND THE WHOLE COMMUNITY MUST PARTICIPATE. IF THE ARMED FORCES ARE NEAR, THEN CLANDESTINE ORGANIZATION MUST BE CONDUCTED IN SMALL TOWNS, VILLAGES, AND NEIGHBORHOODS.  THE PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE THEMSELVE TO CONSPIRE AGAINST DEATH, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THE ASSASSINS, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST POVERTY, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST HUNGER, AND TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THE BOMBINGS.  IT IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE PEOPLE; IT IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.  EL SALVADOR MUST BECOME A BODY COMPRISED OF ORGANIZED CELLS -- EVERYWHERE AND IN EVERY POSSIBLE FORM -- REGARDLESS OF THE PEOPLE'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR POLITICAL PARTY.     WE ISSUE AN APPEAL TO THE DECEIVED ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] RANK AND FILE, WHO VOTED BELIEVING THAT THIS GOVERNMENT WOULD REPRESENT A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.  WE ALSO ISSUE AN APPEAL TO ALL THE PATRIOTIC CITIZENS OF THE HOMELAND, URGING THEM TO STOP THE DESTRUCTION OF THE CAPITAL, TO STOP THE DESTRUCTION OF THE COUNTRY. WE URGE THEM TO UNITE AND STOP THE WAR; AND THE END OF THE WAR IS NEAR -- WITH THE PEOPLE'S VICTORY.  [CONTINUED]",

CAMBARALAMAIA'S ORGANIZATION IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY GANGS IN THE REGION THAT DEALS WITH BOLIVIAN COCAINE.  ANOTHER GANG IS LED BY GERSON PALERMO, OF UMUARAMA, PARANA STATE, WHO CONTROLS THE EXCHANGE OF COCAINE TO PARAGUAY FOR STOLEN BRAZILIAN CARS.  PALERMO OWNS FOUR TWIN-ENGINED CESSNA PLANES AND EMPLOYS MORE THAN 200 MEN.  HE ALSO EXCHANGE CARS FOR COCAINE IN BOLIVIA.  ALTHOUGH SENTENCED BY THE BRAZILIAN COURTS, PALERMO LIVES IN PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO, PARAGUAY, WHERE HE MAINTAINS BUSINESS CONTACTS WITH THE BOLIVIAN COCA PRODUCERS. PALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR REFINING THE DRUG, FROM ARGENTINA.     THE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVES THAT THE DRUG MIGHT BE REFINED IN MATO GROSSO DO SUL, NEAR SOME RESIDENCES IN THE DOURADOS AND CAMPO GRANDE SECTORS.  PALERMO EXCHANGES THE CHEMICALS FOR TONS OF COCAINE PASTE WHICH, IN THE OPINION OF REGIONAL FEDERAL POLICE DELEGATE FRANCISCO VIANA QUEIROZ, IS ALSO PROCESSED IN PARAGUAY.  VIANA QUEIROZ MAINTAINS THAT THE DRUG IS REFINED BY A GROUP OF TRAFFICKERS LED BY ARSENIO BENITEZ GONZALEZ, WHO IS KNOWN AS VILHAR AND WHO LIVES IN ASUNCION. THE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVE THAT VILHAR -- WHO IS BELIEVED TO BE PALERMO'S PARTNER -- IS THE BRAZILIAN TRAFFICKERS' MAIN COCAINE SUPPLIER.     ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, TWO DRUG ROUTES PASS THROUGH MATO GROSSO DO SUL: THE PONTA PORA ROUTE (WHICH IS USED BY PALERMO), AND THE CORUMBA ROUTE, WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE BOLIVIAN TOWN OF PUERTO SUAREZ.  MANY TRAFFICKERS COME TO THIS BOLIVIAN TOWN, MOST OF THEM SMALL SUPPLIERS WHO ONLY WANT TO EXCHANGE COCAINE FOR CARS THAT WERE STOLEN IN BRAZIL.  ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, THE CORUMBA ROUTE IS MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT CHANNELS THE SO-CALLED \"MINI-TRAFFIC.\"  THIS INVOLVES HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO, TOGETHER, MAKE UP A SIZABLE QUANTITY OF DRUGS EVERY DAY.     THE CARS ARE THE HARD CURRENCY USED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS.  MOST OF THEM ARE TAKEN TO BOLIVIA AFTER HAVING BEEN STOLEN IN SAO PAULO.  THEY FOLLOW THE SAME ROUTE AS THE BOLIVIAN COCAINE, THAT IS, VIA PUERTO SUAREZ.  THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE TRAFFICKING, HOWEVER, IS CARRIED OUT IN PARAGUAY AND BOLIVIA.  GERSON PALERMO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PART OF IT, WHILE THE REST IS SHARED BY HUNDREDS OF BOLIVIAN TRAFFICKERS.  PALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE FROM FORMOSA, ARGENTINA.  HE TAKES THESE CHEMICALS ABOARD SMALL PLANES TO THE TOWNS OF PILAR OR ENCARNACION, IN PARAGUAY. FROM THERE, ANOTHER GROUP TAKES THE 200-LITER DRUMS ALONG THE CHACO HIGHWAY TO PUERTO GUARANI, IN BOLIVIA.  BOLIVIAN TRAFFICKERS TAKE CARE OF THE REST OF THE JOURNEY TO SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA.  IN RETURN, PALERMO RECEIVES COCAINE PASTE WHICH IS SHIPPED TO ASUNCION AND, FROM THERE, TO PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO FOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE PROCESSING UNITS.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE TRAFFICKERS USE SOME RANCHES NEAR PORTO MURTINHO (MATO GROSSO DE SUL), NEAR THE PARAGUAYAN TOWN OF BAHIA NEGRA, TO PROCESS LARGE QUANTITIES OF COCAINE.     NO COCAINE PASTE IS USUALLY AVAILABLE ALONG THE CORUMBA ROUTE.  THE DRUG IS REFINED BECAUSE IT IS RELATIVELY EASY TO FIND ETHER AND ACETONE IN CORUMBA, WHERE THE FEDERAL POLICE HAVE FAILED TO REDUCE THE LARGE DEMAND FOR SUCH CHEMICALS IN RETAIL STORES.  DOZENS OF DRUGSTORES SELL THOSE PRODUCTS BY THE LITER, AND THIS IS NOT FORBIDDEN BY LAW.     THE AUTHORITIES ESTIMATE THAT PRODUCTION IN THE PUERTO SUAREZ REGION NEARS 300 KG PER WEEK, WHICH IS TRANSPORTED BY RAILROAD, AIR, AND LAND.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO EVADE THE FEDERAL POLICE, TRAFFICKERS HAVE TRIED TO TRANSPORT THE DRUG INSIDE THEIR BODIES, IN WINE DEMIJOHNS, AND EVEN IN CHILDREN'S DIAPERS.  THESE TRAFFICKERS GENERALLY TRAVEL BY BUS OR BY TRAIN. OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS THE POLICE CAUGHT DOZENS OF TRAFFICKERS USING THESE METHODS.  NOW, HOWEVER, ONLY WITH THE COMPLICITY OF THE POLICE CAN CARS CARRYING BOLIVIAN COCAINE PRODUCED IN THE PUERTO SUAREZ REGION REACH CAMPO GRANDE.",

PRESIDENT, WHEN ONE SEES PERU FACING THE DIFFICULTIES IT IS EXPERIENCING NOW, THE SAME AS OUR OWN COUNTRY AND LATIN AMERICA IN GENERAL, ONE ASKS HIMSELF: WOULD A MAN, A NOVELIST LIKE MARIO VARGAS LLOSA, BE THE RIGHT MAN TO LEAD PERU?     [GARCIA] AS PRESIDENT OF ALL PERUVIANS -- AND OF VARGAS LLOSA TO EVEN IF HE DOES NOT LIKE IT -- I CANNOT PASS JUDGMENT, EITHER ETHICALLY OR INTELLECTUALLY, ON A POLITICIAN AND PERUVIAN WHO IS CONTENDING FOR THE PRESIDENCY.     [REPORTER] WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO AFTER YOU STEP DOWN FROM THE PRESIDENCY?     [GARCIA] WELL, I AM GOING TO BE FREE.     [AMAT] WHY DO YOU NOT COME TO COLOMBIA AND I AM SURE...     [GARCIA, INTERRUPTING] SURE, I ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION, AND I HOPE SOME COLOMBIANS WILL EXTEND IT.  HOWEVER, I WANT TO TELL YOU VERY HONESTLY, THAT I AM PERHAPS BETTER AT SELLING DREAMS, IDEAS, AND DOCTRINES THAN AT ADMINISTERING A SITUATION OF PENURY, LIKE THE ONE OUR COUNTRIES ARE EXPERIENCING, AND MOST PARTICULARLY PERU, WHICH IS ONE OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA.  IT IS VERY DIFFICULT. FOR INSTANCE, ON A DAY WHEN THE PRICE OF RICE OR CHICKEN GOES UP, THE PEOPLE WILL NOT BELIEVE YOU, EVEN IF YOU TELL THEM THE GREATEST OF TRUTHS.  ONE CAN BE PREACHING SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT, BUT IF IT FAILED TO RAIN AND THE CITY HAD NO WATER NO ONE WILL BELIEVE OF YOU THE GREATEST OF ALL TRUTHS.  THEN, WHEN ONE STOPS BEING PRESIDENT AND ADMINISTERING PENURY, ONE CAN DEVOTE ONESELF TO CONVINCING PEOPLE, TO EDUCATING.  THAT IS WHAT I SHOULD DO.     [AMAT] NOW, WHY DID YOU MAKE THAT ASIDE, MAKING ME PRESIDENT OF ALL PERUVIANS, EVEN OF VARGAS LLOSA?  WHETHER HE LIKES OR NOT IT HURTS HIM.     [GARCIA] BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE ME AS PRESIDENT.  [LAUGHTER]     [AMAT] EVEN HIM, FOR INSTANCE?     [GARCIA] I DID NOT SAY SO.  I DO NOT KNOW.  I NEVER FALL TO THE LEVEL OF DEFINING PEOPLE OR POINTING OUT LAST NAMES.  I MAKE AN OUTLINE OR DEFINE THEM IN THE NEGATIVE.     [AMAT] MR. PRESIDENT, [WORDS INDISTINCT] THIS DIALOGUE [WORDS INDISTINCT] FOR YOUR GENEROSITY AND KINDNESS.  ADDRESSING OUR PEOPLE AND OUR COUNTRY, [WORDS INDISTINCT], HOW WERE THINGS TODAY AT THE SUMMIT?     [GARCIA] VERY WELL.  COLOMBIANS, WHO HAVE SEEN THEIR INSTITUTION THREATENED, THEIR PRESS ABUSED, AND MANY POLITICIANS ALSO THREATENED, MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT LATIN AMERICA, TOGETHER WITH THE UNITED STATES, WILL CONFRONT THE PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THIS IS NOT ONLY A PROBLEM FOR COLOMBIA.  IT IS OUR PROBLEM TOO, AND WE WILL TACKLE IT.  THE DAY A NEWSPAPER WAS BLOWN UP IN BOGOTA I CAME TO BOGOTA BECAUSE I FELT THAT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS WAS THREATENED ON THE CONTINENT.  AFTER ALL, WE ARE LATIN AMERICANS.  LET COLOMBIANS HAVE CONFIDENCE.",

THE NEWSPAPER STATED THAT THE ALLEGED RIFT BETWEEN THE MILITARY OFFICERS BEGAN ONCE IT WAS DISCOVERED WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, IN WHICH ONE COLONEL, TWO LIEUTENANTS, AND SIX SOLDIERS ARE BEING CHARGED.     COLONEL PONCE SAID THAT THE RELATIONS WITH U.S. ADVISERS -- ABOUT 52 IN THE COUNTRY -- ARE VERY CORDIAL.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] OUR RELATIONS WITH THE NORTH AMERICANS ARE NORMAL AS USUAL.  THE U.S. ADVISERS HAVE HELPED US VERY MUCH IN THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND THEY CONTINUE WORKING WITH US.     [REPORTER] WHERE DO YOU THINK THESE WIRE REPORTS STATING THERE ARE RIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN MILITARY OFFICERS AND U.S.  ADVISERS HAVE ORGINIATED?     [PONCE] I DO NOT KNOW; I CANNOT UNDERSTAND.  THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE WHO TRY TO BREAK THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES AND THE UNITED STATES.  THIS IS A POOR COUNTRY THAT DEPENDS A GREAT DEAL ON U.S. ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID.     [REPORTER] FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS, WHAT ARE RELATIONS LIKE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN MILITARY AND THE GRINGO ADVISERS?     [PONCE] AS USUAL, THESE RELATIONS ARE VERY CORDIAL, AND THEY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US.  AS YOU CAN SEE, TWO ADVISERS ARE HERE WITH ME NOW AT THE TABLE PRESIDING OVER THE EVENT.  THE SAME HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH ALL THE UNITS IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR.  I FAIL TO SEE ANY DIFFERENCE IN RELATIONS BEFORE AND AFTERWARD. [END RECORDING]     THE MILITARY CHIEF REPEATED THE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, NOT ONLY DUE TO THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS, BUT ALSO TO KEEP CONTROL OVER THE ORGANIZATION FRONTS JUST PRIOR TO AN EXPECTED WAVE OF PROTESTS ON THE LATEST GOVERNMENT ECONOMY MEASURES.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] WE MUST START THINKING WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO DOMESTIC ORDER IN THE FACE OF THE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED OR ARE PLANNED.  WE MUST THINK WHAT THE REACTION OF THE PEOPLE OR THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] ORGANIZATION FRONTS WILL BE, AS THEY ALWAYS USE ANY EXCUSE TO DISRUPT DOMESTIC ORDER.  IT WOULD BE GOOD TO LOOK INTO WHAT IS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN DOMESTIC ORDER IN THE COUNTRY. [END RECORDING]     THE HIGH-RANKING MILITARY OFFICER GAVE THESE STATEMENTS AT THE CEREMONY TO TURN OVER COMMAND OF THE CAPTAIN GENERAL GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY.  THE NEW COMMANDER IS COLONEL RICARDO ALFONSO CASANOVA SANDOVAL, WHO REPLACES COLONEL GUILLERMO ALFREDO BENAVIDES MORENO, REMOVED FROM HIS POST AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF ORDERING THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.     MEANWHILE, COLONEL HECTOR HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ HAS BEEN APPOINTED COMMANDER OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE BASED IN USULUTAN, AND IN LA UNION DEPARTMENT THE CHANGE OF COMMAND CEREMONIES OF THE ARMED FORCES MILITARY TRAINING CENTER HAVE TAKEN PLACE, WHERE COLONEL FRANCISCO ARTURO LOPEZ WILL BE IN COMMAND REPLACING COLONEL CARLOS ALFREDO RIVAS, WHO HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.",

PRESIDENT, THE NEWSPAPER LA JORNADA OF MEXICO STATED YESTERDAY THAT COLONEL ORLANDO ZEPEDA HAD LEFT THE COUNTRY THIS WEEKEND WITH ALL HIS FAMILY AND WITH A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF LUGGAGE, WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT HE DID NOT GO ON A MERE VACATION.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE OFFICIAL VERSION OF THIS. [LAUGHTER]     [CRISTIANI] YOU SAY HE LEFT WHEN?     [REPORTER] YESTERDAY.     [CRISTIANI] WELL, ONLY IF HE LEFT VERY HURRIEDLY AFTER MIDDAY.  I WAS WITH HIM HERE YESTERDAY DISCUSSING OTHER THINGS, AS WELL AS MILITARY MATTERS WITH THE DEFENSE MINISTER AND DEPUTY MINISTERS.  HE WAS PRESENT.  UNLESS HE MAY HAVE LEFT.  I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH, BECAUSE I HAD A MEETING WITH THEM TO SEE THE ORDER OF THE MONTH ON SATURDAY AND HE WAS PRESENT.  PARDON ME, THAT WAS TUESDAY WHEN WE HAD THE ORDER FOR THE END OF THE MONTH.  I UNDERSTAND HE WAS PRESENT AT THE COMMANDERS MEETING.  IF HE LEFT LAST WEEKEND, IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR THE WEEKEND AND HE RETURNED ON MONDAY.     [MODERATOR] MARIA CORTINA, NOTIMEX.     [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, IN WHAT WAY WOULD A CUT IN MILITARY AID AFFECT THE PEACE PROCESS?     [CRISTIANI] WE ARE CURRENTLY SEEING OPPOSITE SIGNS FROM THE FMLN IN TERMS OF WANTING TO TRULY PUT AN END TO VIOLENCE.  A SIGN OF THIS WAS THE NIGHT OF 1 MAY WHEN THE ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT.  THIS WOULD INDICATE THAT, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL THE FMLN COMMAND, THAT IS THE FIVE GROUPS, SOME GROUPS SEEM TO RESIST A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND FAVOR A MILITARY SOLUTION, AS THEY HAVE INSISTED ON PURSUING FOR 10 YEARS. THOSE GROUPS COULD VIEW A CUT IN MILITARY AID AS A SIGN OF WEAKENING OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES, AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY THEY WOULD HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF BEING SUCCESSFUL FOLLOWING THE MILITARY PATH.  THAT COULD INCREASE THE POTENTIAL OF A MILITARY SOLUTION IN THE MINDS OF SOME.  THIS COULD REDUCE THE POTENTIAL OF SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.     [MODERATOR] RAUL MONGE, CADENA RADIO CENTRO.     [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, HOW DO YOU VIEW THE GUERRILLAS' MORALE AT THIS MOMENT?     [CRISTIANI] WELL, I OBVIOUSLY CANNOT BUT BELIEVE THAT THE MORALE OF THE GUERRILLAS AFTER THE OFFENSIVE MUST HAVE DROPPED CONSIDERBLY. THIS IS ESPECIALLY SO SINCE THERE WAS A LARGE SACRIFICE ON THEIR PART IN THE FORM OF CASUALTIES AND THE FACT THAT THE OFFENSIVE DID NOT REPRESENT A SUCCESS, DESPITE THEIR CLAIM THAT IT WAS ONLY A SHOW OF FORCE, WHICH IS A LOT OF MALARKEY.  ALL THE PRIOR DOCUMENTS INDICATED THAT THIS WAS A LARGE-SCALE OPERATION TO THE HILT SEEKING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT AND TO CROWN A MILITARY VICTORY.  WHAT I BELIEVE WAS OF EVEN GREATER IMPACT WAS THAT THEY REALIZED THAT THE PEOPLE OF EL SALVADOR DO NOT SUPPORT THEM AND DO NOT SUPPORT THE PATH OF VIOLENCE. IN THAT SENSE, THEIR HOPES OF A POPULAR INSURRECTION WERE SHATTERED. ON THE CONTRARY, THE PEOPLE DID NOT SUPPORT THE FMLN AND INSTEAD TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEM AND SHOWED THAT THEY DO NOT SUPPORT VIOLENCE.  THIS MUST HAVE CAUSED AN IMPACT ON THE FMLN AND ITS MEMBERS.  I RECENTLY READ IN A VENEZUELAN NEWSPAPER STATEMENTS BY A COMMANDER, WHOSE PSEUDONYM IS GUSTAVO, WHO SAID THAT THEY WERE TIRED OF FOLLOWING THE PATH OF VIOLENCE AND THAT A SOLUTION HAD TO BE FOUND. THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT SOME OF THEIR RANKS ARE GETTING TIRED OF THE MILITARY PATH.  THESE ARE INDICATIONS OF WHAT COULD BE.  WHAT I WANT TO CLEAR UP ONCE AND FOR ALL IS THAT WE DO NOT REACT TO WHETHER OR NOT THE FMLN FEELS STRONG OR FEELS WEAK.  WE KNOW THAT 100 TERRORISTS IN A COUNTRY CAN CAUSE DESTRUCTION AND DEATH AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO AVOID, ALTHOUGH 100 TERRORISTS ARE NOT A FORCE THAT WILL DESTABILIZE A GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, THE DAMAGE THAT THEY CAUSE IS SUCH THAT WE DO NOT WANT IT TO CONTINUE.  [CONTINUED]",

THE REPORT SAYS THAT SAN SALVADOR NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS ARE STILL UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].  ARMED FORCES OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE ADMITTED THAT SOME AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FMLN.  THE REPORT ADDS THAT AS OF 2140 ON 12 NOVEMBER, THERE WAS STILL TENSION IN THE CITY.     SOME SPORADIC SHOOTING WAS STILL HEARD, AND THE SITUATION IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CAPITAL CITY INDICATED THAT OUR COMRADES ARE MAINTAINING THEIR POSITIONS, THEY ARE CARRYING OUT MILITARY ENGINEERING TASKS, OPENING TRENCHES, AND SETTING UP BARRICADES WITH THE COOPERATION OF THE SAN SALVADOR PEOPLE.     PRESS AGENCY REPORTS NOTE THAT THERE IS GREAT TENSION IN THE CAPITAL CITY, AND APPARENTLY THEY ARE EXPECTING [CHANGES THOUGHT] HERE IS A NEWS AGENCY REPORT WHICH SAYS THAT EARLY THIS MORNING, LESS SHOOTING WAS HEARD BECAUSE APPARENTLY EACH SIDE HAD CONSOLIDATED THEIR POSITION.  THAT IS WHAT SOME PRESS AGENCIES ARE REPORTING.     WE HAVE ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ADMITTED THAT SOME AREAS IN THE CAPITAL CITY ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FMLN.  THERE ARE MANY VEHICLES SCATTERED ALL OVER THE STREETS OF SAN SALVADOR.  THAT IS THE REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM SAN SALVADOR, WHERE OUR FIGHTERS IN ZACAMIL AND OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN THE CAPITAL CITY ARE NOW RECEIVING THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FORTIFYING THEMSELVES IN NEIGHBORHOODS.     WE CALL ON THE SAN SALVADORAN YOUTHS TO GO OUT TONIGHT TO COOPERATE WITH THE FMLN FIGHTERS.  MAKE THE ASSASSINS OF MSGR ROMERO PAY DEARLY FOR EVERY STEP THEY TAKE AGAINST THE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN SALVADOR CITY.  IT HAS BEEN 24, 25, NEARLY 26 HOURS SINCE THE FMLN FIGHTERS ESTABLISHED THEIR POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR IN VIEW OF THE REGIME'S INCOMPETENCE.  THE REGIME HAS CLEARLY SAID THAT IT IS INCAPABLE OF CONTROLLING THE SITUATION, AS IT HAS HAD TO DECREE A STATE OF SIEGE THAT BEGAN ON THE EVENING OF 12 NOVEMBER IN SAN SALVADOR.     ANOTHER EVIDENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S WEAKNESS IS THE GAG PLACED ON THE MEDIA.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ALLOWED THE MEDIA TO BROADCAST ITS NEWSCASTS.  WHY DOESN'T THE GOVERNMENT WANT THE PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO NEWSCASTS IN EL SALVADOR?  WHAT IS THE CRISTIANI REGIME HIDING?  THIS IS A QUESTION THAT THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING; THEY WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWER.  THE GOVERNMENT IS AFRAID, IT DOES NOT WANT TO INFORM THE PEOPLE ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTS OR THE SCOPE OF THE ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.     COMRADE FIGHTERS: WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU; THIS IS IN THE BAG. YOUR COURAGE AND DETERMINATION TO WIN HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT THE FMLN PLAN AS OUR COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE GENERAL COMMAND HAS SAID.     COMRADES: KEEP IT UP, KEEP AN OPEN EYE, KEEP UP THE HIGH MORALE AS YOU HAVE DONE UP TO NOW, SEEK CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE, RECEIVE THEIR COOPERATION IN THE FORTIFICATIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE THROUGHOUT SAN SALVADOR.

HE SAID THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION IS CONTINUING ITS EFFORTS TO FORM A COMMISSION FOR A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS AND THAT HE IS NOW AWAITING WORD FROM TWO PEOPLE WHOM HE HAS CHOSEN TO SERVE ON THE COMMISSION. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED ON THE COMMISSION BECAUSE THE COMMISSION IS COMPLETELY POLITICAL IN NATURE.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF NATIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR COLONEL ROBERTO ARMANDO RIVERA ESCOBAR, WHO WAS KILLED IN A MACHINEGUN ATTACK THIS MORNING.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ATTRIBUTED RIVERA'S MURDER TO THE FMLN:     [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] IT IS CLEAR THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT WANT PEACE BUT INSTEAD WANTS TO CONTINUE THE VIOLENCE.  THE FMLN COMMITTED THIS CRIME.  I BELIEVE THAT A TREACHEROUS CRIME SUCH AS THIS ONE CANNOT BE CALLED ANYTHING BUT A COWARDLY ACT.  WE WILL, OF COURSE, INVESTIGATE THE CRIME.  I REPEAT, HOWEVER, THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE GATHERED ON THE FMLN'S PLANS INDICATE THAT IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION.     [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PREPARE THE COMMISSION THAT IS TO HOLD TALKS [WORDS INDISTINCT]?     [CRISTIANI] THE TERRORISTS WILL NOT OF COURSE BE SUCCESSFUL WITH ACTIONS OF THIS KIND AND WILL NOT PROVOKE US INTO VIOLENT ACTION. THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND BY NOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS SEARCHING FOR PEACE AND WANTS TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITHIN EL SALVADOR'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND BY APPLYING THE LAW.  THE FMLN REBELS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR TERRORIST ACTIONS WILL NOT LEAD US TO TAKE RASH ACTIONS; IT IS USELESS FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO ACT IN THIS WAY.     WE ARE CONTINUING OUR WORK ON SETTING UP THE COMMISSION.  TODAY WE WILL SPEAK WITH TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE STILL NOT TOLD US IF THEY WILL ACCEPT MY INVITATION TO BE COMMISSION MEMBERS.  THE NAMES OF THE COMMISSION MEMBERS WILL BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC ONCE THE COMMISSION IS FULLY FORMED.     [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S ROLE IN THIS COMMISSION?     [CRISTIANI] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED IN THIS COMMISSION BECAUSE IT IS A POLITICAL COMMISSION AND NOT ONE IN WHICH THE CHURCH CAN EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPATE.  THE CHURCH HAS ALWAYS WORKED FOR PEACE AND HAS MADE ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS TO FIND PEACE FOR THE COUNTRY THE CHURCH WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD THIS GOAL.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT THE CHURCH HAS A DIFFERENT ROLE TO PLAY IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE, AND THAT ROLE IS NOT SERVING ON THE POLITICAL COMMISSION.     [REPORTER] WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN THE MONTH THAT YOU HAVE SERVED AS PRESIDENT?     [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE THAT THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE HAS BEEN OUR INABILITY TO LAUNCH OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM, WHICH IS DUE TO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS EXISTING IN THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE TOOK OVER. WE HAVE REPEATEDLY OBSERVED THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE MAJORITY OF GOVERNMENT [WORD INDISTINCT].  THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT OFFICES, DISORDER WAS RAMPANT, AND, IN MANY CASES, WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICES WERE MANAGED IRRESPONSIBLY.  MOREOVER, THE NATION'S PUBLIC FINANCES HAVE GREATLY DETERIORATED.  WE HAVE INHERITED A COUNTRY IN VERY BAD FINANCIAL SHAPE, AND, I BELIEVE, THIS HAS DELAYED THE LAUNCHING OF OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. [END RECORDING]     CRISTIANI, REFERRING TO COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS' OFFER TO HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS IN COSTA RICAN TERRITORY, SAID THAT THE OFFER WAS A GREAT CONTRIBUTION TOWARD CONVINCING THE FMLN TO STOP MURDERING DEFENSELESS CITIZENS.",

FOR LIBERAL CESAR GAVIRIA TRUJILLO, \"NONVIOLENT SOLUTIONS\" MUST BE FOUND THROUGH A CONDITIONED DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLAS AND BY STRENGTHENING JUSTICE TO CONFRONT THE NARCOTRAFFICKERS \"BECAUSE EXTRADITION CANNOT BE THE ONLY PATH TO FIGHT THIS CRIME.\"     GAVIRIA, 43, WHO ACCORDING TO THE POLLS IS THE FAVORITE TO SUCCEED VIRGILIO BARCO AS PRESIDENT AFTER THE 27 MAY ELECTIONS, HAS MADE THE PROBLEMS OF THE GUERRILLAS AND DRUG MAFIAS THE TWO MAIN ISSUES IN HIS GOVERNMENT PLATFORM.     REGARDING THE ARMED REBELS, HE INSISTS THAT NONVIOLENT SOLUTIONS MUST BE FOUND AND PROMISES TO \"TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION\" THE MERITS OF WHAT HAS BEEN TESTED UP TO NOW.     \"THE DIALOGUE WITH THE ARMED REBELS IS A CONCESSION THAT HAS BEEN MADE TO THEM, AND FOR THIS REASON SOCIETY HAS EVERY RIGHT TO ESTABLISH CONDITIONS,\" GAVIRIA STATED.  \"THUS,\" HE ADDED, \"THE DIALOGUE WILL PREVENT THE GUERRILLAS FROM HAVING A POLITICAL PROTAGONIST ROLE AND WILL AVERT THE JUSTIFICATION OF VIOLENCE.\"     SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE RODRIGO LLOREDA CAICEDO, 47, INSISTS THAT \"THE SURRENDER OF THE MAFIA LORDS MUST BE ACHIEVED\" AND THAT THIS \"SHOULD INCLUDE PENALTIES FOR THE CRIMES COMMITTED, ECONOMIC COMPENSATION, AND THE CERTAINTY THAT COLOMBIA WILL NOT CONTINUE TO LEND ITSELF TO PRODUCE AND EXPORT DRUGS.\"     LLOREDA CAICEDO IS OPPOSED TO THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO THE UNITED STATES, AND HE OFFERS TO \"STRENGTHEN JUSTICE\" AND TO CHANGE PROCEDURES SO AS TO SURROUND JUDGES WITH GUARANTEES, ALL WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM THROUGH A PLEBISCITE TO CONVOKE A NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.     FOR THE ARMED REBELS, HE OFFERS \"A 12-MONTH TERM FOR THEM TO REJOIN CIVILIAN LIFE\" AND THE DRAFTING OF \"MECHANISMS\" FOR THEIR DISBANDING, SUCH AS THE \"NATIONAL CIRCUMSCRIPTION\" THAT WILL FACILITATE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC AND POLITICAL LIFE.     LLOREDA CAICEDO, FOREIGN MINISTER DURING BELISARIO BETANCUR'S ADMINISTRATION AND ONE OF THE PROPONENTS OF THE CONTADORA GROUP TO ATTAIN PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, SAID THAT AN EFFORT MUST BE MADE TO \"RECOVER THE MONOPOLY OF THE PUBLIC FORCE AND CONSOLIDATE ITS SOVEREIGN PRESENCE.\"     ALVARO GOMEZ HURTADO, 71, A \"DISSIDENT\" CONSERVATIVE, MAINTAINS THAT WITHOUT THE STRENGTHENING OF MORALS AND THE LAW -- \"THE ROOT OF OUR ILLS\" -- COEXISTENCE AND PROGRESS WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE.  HE PLEDGES TO RESCUE THOSE TWO VALUES.     GOMEZ HURTADO PRESENTED TO COLOMBIAN VOTERS A FIVE-POINT \"AGREEMENT ON BASIC ISSUES,\" INCLUDING LAW AND MORALS, JUSTICE, ECONOMIC PLANNING, AND ECOLOGY, AS HIS GOVERNMENT PLATFORM IF HE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT ON 27 MAY.     ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, THE M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, WHO REPLACED THE ASSASSINATED CARLOS PIZARRO, BELIEVES THAT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM ARE \"BASIC\" TO REACHING PEACE.     NAVARRO WOLFF, 41, HAS REITERATED THAT HE DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS, AND HE ALSO CONDEMNED THE CHAIN OF ATTACKS PERPETRATED BY DRUG TERRORISTS IN THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS.     REGARDING THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, HOWEVER, HE SAID THAT THEY REQUIRE \"MORE SERIOUS TREATMENT.\"  THEREFORE, IT IS BETTER TO HAVE \"A POOR DIALOGUE RATHER THAN A GOOD WAR,\" AND IF THAT DIALOGUE PRODUCES GOOD RESULTS \"WE MUST HOLD ON TO IT,\" HE SAID.     THE FOUR CANDIDATES AGREE ON REFORMING THE CONGRESS OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE CONSTITUTION BY CONVOKING A NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY. THEY ALSO SHARE OPINIONS ON THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC OPENING TOWARD INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, ACCESS TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT, AND PROMOTION OF AN \"AGRO-INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION\" WHICH WILL GUARANTEE A REDUCTION OR STABILIZATION OF THE RATE OF INFLATION.",

THERE WAS SPECIAL INTEREST IN THE MEETING, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT WAS KNOWN THAT A LETTER HAD BEEN SENT TO THE BISHOPS BY THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, REQUESTING THE CHURCH'S MEDIATION AND ITS EFFORTS TO RESUME A DIALOGUE.  \"I BELIEVE,\" MSGR RIVERA Y DAMAS SAID, \"THAT THE MEETINGS OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE FMLN WITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL ARE IMPORTANT.\"     TO CONCLUDE, RIVERA Y DAMAS REITERATED THAT \"WE MUST END THIS WAR THROUGH DIALOGUE AND RATIONAL MEANS BEFORE THE WAR FINISHES US ALL.\"",

THE ARMY AND THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT ARE OPPOSED TO TRUE NEGOTIATIONS.  THE PEOPLE HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE.  IN EL SALVADOR THERE IS A LATENT PATH, THE PATH OF ARMED ACTIONS.  AT THIS MOMENT, AS THIS GOVERNMENT INCREASES REPRESSION, ARMED ACTIONS BECOME INCREASINGLY LEGITIMATE, ARMED ACTIONS TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO THE CONFLICT, ARMED ACTIONS TO STOP THE REPRESSION BY THE REGIME.     THE WORKERS AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS AND LABOR UNIONS ARE ENTITLED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND THEIR LABOR BENEFITS.  DEFENSE IS LEGITIMATE. IT IS LEGITIMATE FOR THE WORKERS TO DECIDE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES THE ARMED WAY, THROUGH VIOLENCE.  IT IS THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT, PONCE, AND THE HIGH COMMAND WHO ARE LEAVING THE WORKERS NO ALTERNATIVE.     [REPORTER] TO CONCLUDE, COMMANDER: IN RECENT HOURS THERE HAVE BEEN ATTACKS IN THE CAPITAL, INCLUDING BOMB ATTACKS ON THE RESIDENCES OF DEMOCRATIC LEADERS SUCH AS RUBEN ZAMORA AND ARONETE DIAZ, AN ATTACK ON THE RESIDENCE OF COLONEL CARRANZA, AND AN ATTACK ON A RELATIVE OF COLONEL LOPEZ HUILA, AMONG OTHERS.  THE ARMED FORCES AND THE GOVERNMENT HAVE PUBLICLY SAID THAT THE FMLN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ATTACKS.     [GONZALEZ] OUR ARMED ACTIONS ARE HIGHLY JUST AND HAVE POLITICAL MOTIVATIONS.  OUR OBJECTIVES ARE STRICTLY MILITARY.  ALL OUR GUERRILLA UNITS FUNCTION ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE, BE IT IN THE RURAL AREAS OR IN THE CITIES WHERE OUR URBAN COMMANDOS OPERATE.     THE ATTACK ON THE ARMED FORCES STAFF INSTALLATIONS AND OTHER OPERATIONS AGAINST MILITARY TARGETS ARE OUR RESPONSIBILITY.  THE FMLN'S POLICY IS NOT TO ATTACK RELATIVES OF MILITARY MEN OR POLITICIANS.  THE HIGH COMMAND HAS BEEN TRYING TO CONFUSE THE PEOPLE HERE AND ABROAD.  WHAT IS ITS OBJECTIVE?  TO COVER UP ITS REPRESSIVE POLICY.  IT IS ESCALATING ITS ACTIONS.  IT HAS GONE FROM THE SELECTIVE CAPTURE AND MURDER OF LEADERS TO MASS ARRESTS, AND FROM MASS ARRESTS IT HAS MOVED INTO GENOCIDE AND INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS.     IT IS CLEAR THAT ITS OBJECTIVE IS THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT IN SAN JOSE.  IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE HIGH COMMAND IS TRYING TO CREATE CONFUSION, BUT THE PEOPLE ABROAD AND WE KNOW THAT OUR ACTIONS ARE AIMED AT MILITARY OBJECTIVES.",

A COMMUNIQUE BY THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY (URNG), RELEASED IN COSTA RICA, STRESSED THAT 126 ELITE TROOPS OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY, KNOWN AS KAIBILES, ARE COLLABORATING WITH SALVADORAN SOLDIERS TO PUT AN END TO THE OFFENSIVE BY GUERRILLAS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN).     THE URNG CHARGE, ALSO PRESENTED BY THE FMLN, HAS BEEN CATEGORICALLY AND REPEATEDLY DENIED BY GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT SPOKESWOMAN CLAUDIA ARENAS.     THE REBEL COMMUNIQUE STATED: \"WE VIGOROUSLY CONDEMN THE INTERVENTION OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AGAINST THE GLORIOUS SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE WILL MAKE THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AND GOVERNMENT PAY DEARLY FOR THIS AGGRESSION.\"     THE NOTE WAS RELEASED SHORTLY AFTER SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED THE VICTORY OF HIS COUNTRY'S ARMY OVER THE FMLN, FOLLOWING FIERCE FIGHTING THAT LEFT APPROXIMATELY 1,000 DEAD AND MORE THAN 1,500 WOUNDED IN THE PAST 7 DAYS.     IN ADDITION, THE GUATEMALAN GUERRILLAS EXPRESSED SOLIDARITY \"WITH THE COMMUNITY OF JESUIT PRIESTS\" AND THEIR SORROW BECAUSE OF THE KILLING OF SIX OF THEIR MEMBERS, INCLUDING CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY RECTOR IGNACIO ELLACURIA AND TWO WOMEN, CARRIED OUT BY UNIFORMED MEN IN SAN SALVADOR ON 16 NOVEMBER.

    "doctext": "BOGOTA, 26 APR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE EXTRADITABLES, THE ARMED BRANCH OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, DENIED TODAY IN A TELEPHONE CALL TO A RADIO STATION BY AN ALLEGED MEMBER, ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEATH OF CARLOS PIZARRO, POLITICAL LEADER AND FORMER GUERRILLA COMMANDER.     THE CALLER IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS JOHN JAIRO ARIAS TASCON.  HE CALLED THE CARACOL NETWORK IN MEDELLIN TO DENOUNCE THAT THE CHARGES AGAINST THE MEDELLIN CARTEL ARE PART OF A PLAN TO BLAME THEM FOR ALL VIOLENT ACTIONS IN THE COUNTRY.     THE AUTHORS OF THE ASSASSINATION ARE SECTORS WHO SEEK TO DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY, ARIAS TASCON ADDED.     PIZARRO, FORMER LEADER OF THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19), THE GUERRILLA GROUP THAT LAID DOWN ITS WEAPONS ON 9 MARCH, WAS KILLED BY THE IMPACT OF THREE BULLETS FIRED AT HIM ABOARD A COLOMBIAN AVIANCA FLIGHT THAT WAS EN ROUTE TO THE CITY OF BARRANQUILLA ALONG THE COUNTRY'S ATLANTIC COAST.     AFTER THE CRIME, AT 1100 (1600 GMT), AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS SAPATOCA CALLED CARACOL TO REPORT THAT THE KILLING HAD BEEN ORDERED BY FIDEL CASTANO AND HENRY PEREZ, HEADS OF THE EXTREME RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY MILITIAS.     SAPATOCA ADDED THAT CASTANO AND PEREZ PERPETRATED THE CRIME FOLLOWING ORDERS FROM THE EXTRADITABLES.     CASTANO WAS CONNECTED TO THE DEATH OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO, ALSO A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, FOR THE LEFTIST PATRIOTIC UNION (UP), ON 22 MARCH, ALTHOUGH AT THAT TIME IT WAS REPORTED THAT CASTANO HEADED A PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATION THAT DID NOT IMPLICATE THE EXTRADITABLES.     ON THAT OCCASION PABLO ESCOBAR, LEADER OF THE EXTRADITABLES AND THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, DENIED THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD KILLED JARAMILLO.     A CONFIDENTIAL REPORT DRAFTED RECENTLY BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS, COLOMBIAN SECRET POLICE), SAID THAT SOME ARMY AND POLICE MEMBERS COOPERATE WITH CASTANO'S CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION.     NAVARRO WOLFF, NUMBER TWO LEADER OF M-19, TOLD NEWSMEN TODAY AFTER PIZARRO WAS KILLED THAT HIS BURIAL MUST BE ATTENDED BY ALL THE COUNTRY, BECAUSE WE MUST REPUDIATE CRIME SUCH AS THIS.     NAVARRO WOLFF SAID THAT PIZARRO'S DEATH SHOWS THAT THE COUNTRY IS IN TURMOIL AND THAT IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO REBUILD THE COUNTRY. THERE IS NO SPACE EXCEPT FOR PAIN AND FOR IRE, HE ADDED.     THE BURIAL OF CARLOS MUST BE PEACEFUL, AS WAS M-19'S EXAMPLE OF PEACE GIVEN TO THE COUNTRY, HE ADDED.     IT IS HARD TO EXPLAIN HOW THINGS SUCH AS THIS OCCUR WHEN THE M-19 AND CARLOS PIZARRO WERE SETTING AN EXAMPLE OF PRUDENCE, TOLERANCE, AND UNDERSTANDING, NAVARRO SAID.     PIZARRO, A FORMER GUERRILLA COMMANDER WHO LED HIS ARMED GROUP TOWARD DEMOBILIZATION AFTER 17 MONTHS OF POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF VIRGILIO BARCO, TOLD NEWSMEN BEFORE BOARDING THE AIRCRAFT: WE ARE DOING WELL. THIS WAS A REFERENCE TO THE M-19 ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN.     PIZARRO STATED IN HIS LAST PUBLIC STATEMENT: I AM CERTAIN THAT WE WILL KNOW HOW TO WAGE OPPOSITION.  WE WILL ENGAGE IN A VERY PRETTY DEMOCRATIC PLAY WITH REGARD TO THE NEXT GOVERNMENT.  WE WILL PARTICIPATE IN BUILDING NEW COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY.     THE M-19 PARTICIPATED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE 11 MARCH ELECTIONS, BECOMING THE THIRD POLITICAL FORCE IN BOGOTA.     NOTHING HAS BEEN SAID YET CONCERNING THE BURIAL OF PIZARRO, WHO WAS BORN 39 YEARS AGO IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS AND WHO LEAVES THREE ORPHAN DAUGHTERS, AGED 12, 9, AND 4.",

[PONCE] I BELIEVE THAT SPECIFIC MEASURES WE HAVE ADOPTED HAVE GIVEN US GOOD RESULTS.  THEY HAVE LAUNCHED FOUR SA-7'S IN THE ZACATECOLUCA AREA; HOWEVER, OUR PILOTS HAVE SKILLFULLY AVOIDED THE ROCKETS OR MISSILES, WHICH DID NOT HIT THEIR AIRCRAFT.  WE ARE ADOPTING MEASURES THAT ARE GIVING RESULTS.  WE MUST ALSO CLARIFY THAT WE FEEL THAT SINCE THE LIGHT AIRCRAFT TRANSPORTING THESE MISSILES DID NOT HAVE A NORMAL LANDING AND THE MISSILES WERE NOT IN THEIR ORIGINAL PACKAGE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY SUFFERED SOME FUNCTIONAL DAMAGE WHEN THE PLANE CRASHED SOUTH OF ZACATECOLUCA.  THANK GOD, [WORDS INDISTINCT]     [REPORTER] DO YOU THINK THAT THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS CAN OPEN NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR RESUMING TALKS WITH THE FMLN?  DO YOU THINK THAT THIS SUMMIT COULD BRING ABOUT NEW STEPS TOWARD A DIALOGUE?     [PONCE] YES, I THINK THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR HAS OPENED THIS POSSIBILITY AND IS WILLING TO TALK ON A PERMANENT BASIS.  I THINK THAT AT THIS TIME IT WOULD BE A POSITIVE STEP IN THE POLITICAL FIELD.     HOWEVER, IN THE MILITARY FIELD, WHERE THE FMLN HAS ATTACKED US IN AN IRRATIONAL AND VIOLENT WAY IN THE MAIN CITIES, THE ARMED FORCES IS REPLYING, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO REPLY.  WE WILL COMPLETELY DEFEAT THE FMLN.     BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM OUR UNITS, WE HAVE INFLICTED 1,902 DEAD, 1,209 WOUNDED, AND 44 TERRORISTS HAVE DESERTED AND TURNED THEMSELVES IN TO THE AUTHORITIES.  WE HAVE CONFISCATED A LARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS.  I WILL GIVE YOU THE QUANTITIES: 25 ANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILES -- ONE RED EYE AND 24 SA-7'S -- 915 RIFLES, 12 CARBINES, 11 SHOTGUNS, 156 GRENADE AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 49 MORTARS, 45 MACHINEGUNS, 41 SUBMACHINEGUNS, 67 REVOLVERS AND PISTOLS, 23 RADIOS, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF EXPLOSIVES.     I MUST STRESS THAT THE FMLN HAS GATHERED ALL THESE WEAPONS WITH SUPPPORT FROM ABROAD.  IT IS A LARGE ARSENAL.     I MUST ALSO NOTE THAT MANY OF THE WEAPONS WE FOUND HAD BEEN ABANDONED, WHICH MEANS THAT THE FMLN HAS HAD MANY DESERTIONS.  WE HAVE ALSO FOUND WEAPONS IN HOUSES, THANKS TO THE COLLABORATION OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.     WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE FMLN HAS KIDNAPPED A LARGE NUMBER OF YOUTHS HERE IN THE SAN SALVADOR AREA AND MAINLY IN USULUTAN, AS WELL AS IN CHALATENANGO.  THIS MEANS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO FILL IN THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES THEY HAVE SUFFERED WITH YOUTHS.  THIS ALSO MEANS THAT THEIR EFFICIENCY WILL BE VERY LOW.     [REPORTER] I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS A LEAFLET ISSUED BY THE AIR FORCE, WHICH WAS DROPPED FROM AIRPLANES AND ALSO DISTRIBUTED ON THE STREETS.  THE LEAFLET URGES SALVADORAN PATRIOTS TO DEFEND THEIR HOMELAND, THEIR PROPERTIES, AND LIVES.  IT ALSO SAYS THAT IF NECESSARY, TERRORISTS MUST BE KILLED, AS WELL AS THEIR INTERNATIONALIST ALLIES.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THIS LEAFLET? IS IT NOT AN INVITATION TO KILL FOREIGNERS IN THIS COUNTRY?     [PONCE] I DO NOT THINK SO, BECAUSE THE LEAFLETS MENTION INTERNATIONALISTS, WHO ARE FIGHTING ALONG WITH THE FMLN.  [CONTINUED]",

THROUGH A COMMUNIQUE, THE GUERRILLAS EMPHASIZED THE ARMED CLASH TOOK PLACE AFTER HONDURAN ARMY TROOPS ATTACKED IN THE HAMLET OF SAN ANDRES, SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT, IN NORTHERN EL SALVADOR.     MEMBERS OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY ARCE BATTALION, WHO WERE CONDUCTING AN OPERATION NEAR THE HONDURAN BORDER, RESPONDED, SUPPORTED BY TWO AIR FORCE HELICOPTERS.     THE REPORT BY THE REBELS, BROADCAST FROM SAN SALVADOR BY TEGUCIGALPA RADIO AMERICA, ADDED THAT AN UNNAMED ARCE BATTALION OFFICER WAS KILLED IN THE CLASH.     THE HONDURAN TROOPS THEN RETREATED TO LOS LLANITOS, INTIBUCA DEPARTMENT, IN HONDURAS, WHERE FOUR SALVADORAN HELICOPTERS LANDED, ACCORDING TO THE FMLN.     THE REPORT ADDED THAT AS A HONDURAN HELICOPTER EVACUATED THE WOUNDED, IT WAS ATTACKED AND PURSUED 7 KM INSIDE HONDURAN TERRITORY BY A SALVADORAN AIRCRAFT FIRING ROCKETS AND MACHINEGUNS.     THE HONDURAN SOLDIERS WERE SURROUNDED IN LOS LLANITOS AND TAKEN PRISONER.     THE FMLN STATED THAT SEVERAL HOMES WERE DAMAGED AND THAT ANIMALS WERE KILLED IN THE SURROUNDING HAMLETS AND VILLAGES.     THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLA NOTED THAT IT HAD PREVIOUSLY WARNED THAT THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE HONDURAN ARMY \"DUE TO U.S. DISPOSITIONS\" IN THE EL SALVADOR WAR, WOULD RESULT IN CLASHES AMONG THE ARMIES OF CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES.     THE FMLN REPORT STATES THAT \"IT IS NO SECRET THAT THE OLIGARCHS WHO [WILL ] REACH POWER THROUGH THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) GOVERNMENT ARE THE SAME PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE 1969 INVASION OF HONDURAS.\"     THE OFFICERS, WHO AT THAT TIME \"WERE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR KILLINGS, PILLAGING, AND OUTRAGES AGAINST THE HONDURAN PEOPLE, ARE TODAY MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES LEADERSHIP,\" THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS.

THE HONDURAN MILITARY HAS NEITHER DENIED NOR CONFIRMED THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS REPORTS, AND AN ARMY SPOKESMAN HAS STATED THAT INVESTIGATIONS ARE BEING CONDUCTED.     THE HONDURAN ARMED FORCES, HAVE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, REPORTED THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAVE \"HIDEOUTS\" IN SALVADORAN REFUGEE CAMPS, AND CONTINUOUSLY ENTER HONDURAN TERRITORY TO REST OR FOR RESUPPLY OF WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION.",

BOTERO SAID THAT INITIAL INVESTIGATIONS HAVE REVEALED THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA PLANNED AND ORDERED THE ATTACK ON JARAMILLO OSSA.  GEN. BOTERO TOLD REPORTERS THAT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL CONTRACTED THE SERVICES OF AN ORGANIZATION OF HIRED ASSASSINS AND SENT THEM TO BOGOTA TO ASSASSINATE THE UP LEADER.     HE ADDED THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA ORDERED THE DELIVERY OF AN INITIAL SUM OF 300,000 PESOS TO A THIRD PERSON AFTER THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED AT EL DORADO AIRPORT'S PEDESTRIAN OVERPASS IN BOGOTA.     THE DEFENSE MINISTER SAID THAT MINUTES AFTER THE KILLING THE DAS [ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY] INTELLIGENCE SERVICE INTERCEPTED AN ESCOBAR GAVIRIA CONVERSATION IN MEDELLIN.  HE WAS ORDERING HIS ACCOMPLICES TO PAY 300,000 PESOS TO A THIRD PERSON LINKED TO THE PAID ASSASSIN WHO KILLED THE UP LEADER.     BOTERO ALSO DISCLOSED THAT THE ASSASSIN IS A 16-YEAR-OLD YOUTH WHO CARRIED A FALSE IDENTIFICATION CARD UNDER THE NAME OF JAIRO ALBERTO RESTREPO POSADA.     MEANWHILE, ANONYMOUS CALLS WERE RECEIVED BY VARIOUS BOGOTA MEDIA TODAY.  THE CALLERS WERE ATTRIBUTING THE ATTACK ON UP LEADER JARAMILLO OSSA TO A SO-CALLED GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA COMMANDO GROUP. IN THESE CALLS, IT WAS SAID THAT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL DECIDED TO RESUME THE WAR BECAUSE FOR FIVE MONTHS IT OFFERED TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS GOVERNMENT, AND THE ONLY RESPONSE IT RECEIVED WAS TO URGE CARTEL MEMBERS TO TURN THEMSELVES IN TO JUSTICE.     IN ADDITION, THREATS WERE MADE AGAINST OTHER COLOMBIAN POLITICAL FIGURES SUCH AS LIBERAL PARTY CANDIDATE CESAR GAVIRIA TRUJILLO. THE CALLERS SAID THAT THE EXTRADITABLES RELEASED KIDNAPPED PEOPLE, DELIVERED LABORATORIES, AND LARGE QUANTITIES OF DYNAMITE AS PROOF OF THEIR INTENTION TO TALK, BUT THEY NEVER RECEIVED A REPLY FROM THE GOVERNMENT.     THE CALLERS SAID: WE ARE GOING TO TURN OURSELVES IN, BUT WE WILL BE DEAD WHEN WE DO SO.  HOWEVER, BEFORE THIS HAPPENS, THEY SAID, THE COUNTRY WILL SEE THE BODIES OF ITS LEADERS, JUST AS IN THE CASE OF JARAMILLO OSSA.",

MERINO DESCRIBED THE CULPRITS AS MURDEROUS BEASTS.     THE VICE PRESIDENT WENT TO THE MEDICAL-SURGICAL HOSPITAL OF THE SALVADORAN INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL SECURITY, TO WHICH DR GUERRERO WAS TAKEN AFTER THE ATTACK.  GUERRERO, WHO WAS AN ADVISER TO THE GOVERNMENTAL COMMISSION FOR SUPPORT TO THE DIALOGUE [COMISION DE APOYO GUBERNAMENTAL DE DIALOGO], WAS SHOT TO DEATH BY TERRORISTS AT THE INTERSECTION OF BOULEVARD DE LOS HEROES AND ALAMEDA JUAN PABLO II.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] WHAT THEY ARE SHOWING IS THAT THEY ARE BENT ON CARRYING OUT TOTALLY DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS TO LOWER THE CONFIDENCE OF THE POPULATION AND TO PROVOKE GENERAL PANIC.  I THINK THAT ALTHOUGH AS A GOVERNMENT WE HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED A CONCILIATORY POSITION TO ATTAIN PEACE IN EL SALVADOR, WE MUST ALSO MAKE A FIRMER DECISION TO TAKE STRONGER ACTION.  THE PEOPLE WHO COMMIT THESE WANTON ACTIONS ARE DERANGED PEOPLE.  THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND WORDS.  THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MUST RESPECT A LEGAL SYSTEM, OR A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS OR ONE OF HUMANIZATION.  THEY ARE SIMPLY BEASTS AND MURDERERS AND MUST BE TREATED AS SUCH.  [END RECORDING]     MERINO SAID THE MURDERERS MUST BE PUNISHED WITH THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE LAWS, AND THAT ONE OF THE TERRORISTS WHO WAS WOUNDED AND CAPTURED AT THE SITE OF THE CRIME IS UNDER INTERROGATION.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] ONE OF THE CRIMINALS WAS WOUNDED.  THIS WILL OBVIOUSLY ENABLE US TO OBTAIN SOME CLUES AS TO THE IDENTITY OF THE ACTUAL KILLERS AND OF THE MASTERMINDS OF THIS NEW MURDER, WHICH HAS SHOCKED SALVADORAN SOCIETY.     AS IN PREVIOUS CASES, WE ARE CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS IN THIS CASE.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO TAKE A FIRMER STAND, TO DO OUR UTMOST, AND TO REALIZE THAT IF NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO US THUS FAR, IT DOES NOT MEAN WE WILL NOT FALL VICTIM TO THESE MURDERERS.  IT IS BETTER TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS NOW THAN TO HAVE REGRETS LATER.  [END RECORDING]     MERINO SAID THAT THIS CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE PROMOTED BY THE TERRORIST HORDES HAS NOT ENDED.  CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THIS IS THIS BRUTAL AND COWARDLY MURDER, WHICH HAS AGAIN FILLED THE SUFFERING SALVADORAN PEOPLE WITH SORROW.",

ACCORDING TO MEMBERS OF THE UNIVERSITY STUDENT ASSOCIATION [AEU] OF SAN CARLOS DE GUATEMALA UNIVERSITY, THE STUDENTS LEADERS DECIDED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUOUS THREATS OF DEATH AND PERSECUTION AND DUE TO THE KIDNAPPING AND ASSASSINATION OF FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.     THE NAMES OF THE STUDENTS WHO FLED THE COUNTRY ARE BEING KEPT SECRET TO PROTECT THEIR RELATIVES WHO LIVE IN GUATEMALA CITY AND IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY, THE SOURCES MAINTAINED.     THREE OF THE STUDENTS TRAVELED TO PANAMA, ONE TO MEXICO, AND ANOTHER TO COSTA RICA.     THIS MONTH, THE CORPSES OF FIVE ASSASSINATED AEU LEADERS WERE FOUND IN THE CAPITAL, SOME WITH SIGNS OF TORTURE.  SIX OTHER UNIVERSITY STUDENT LEADERS REMAIN KIDNAPPED.     BELISARIO POLO, STUDENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PANAMA, TODAY TOLD EFE THAT THE THREE AEU LEADERS ARRIVED IN THE COUNTRY LAST WEEKEND AND ARE LIVING IN PRIVATE HOUSES.     GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SAID THEY HAVE NO OFFICIAL REPORTS ON THE DEPARTURE OF THE HIGHEST AEU LEADERS.     THE DEPARTURE OF THE FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS LEADERS COINCIDES WITH THE VISIT TO GUATEMALA OF PETER KOOIJMANS, WHO YESTERDAY MET GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND ARMY OFFICERS TO GATHER INFORMATION.     DURING HIS MEETING WITH GOVERNMENT MINISTER ROBERTO VALLE, KOOIJMANS REQUESTED REPORTS ON THE INVESTIGATIONS THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONDUCTED ON THE CASE OF THE KIDNAPPED STUDENTS, THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAID.     THE KIDNAPPING AND ASSASSINATION OF THE FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND THE THREATS AGAINST OTHER AEU MEMBERS HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED BY LEADERS FROM UNIVERSITIES IN MEXICO, HONDURAS, PERU, COLOMBIA, COSTA RICA, EL SALVADOR, NICARAGUA, AND PANAMA.     UNIVERSITY STUDENTS LEADERS FROM CANADA, ECUADOR, CHILE, AND THE FRG HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR SOLIDARITY AND DEMANDED THAT THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE THESE ASSASSINATIONAS.     THE AEU REQUESTED THE HIGHER UNIVERSITY COUNCIL TO SUSPEND CLASSES FOR THE CURRENT SEMESTER IN VIEW OF THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE GUATEMALA IS SUFFERING AND IN VIEW OF THE DEATH THREATS AGAINST THE MAIN STUDENT LEADERS.  AS A RESPONSE, THE CSU HAS DECIDED TO LET EACH ACADEMIC SECTION DECIDE THE STRATEGY IT WILL IMPLEMENT TO GET PROTECTION FROM THE VIOLENCE. SEVERAL OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY SCHOOLS HAVE MODIFIED THE EVENING SCHEDULE, AND MOST CLASSES HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO 2-HOURS PERIODS SO STUDENTS CAN RETURN HOME EARLY.     SEVERAL LABOR UNION ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CONDEMNED THE KIDNAPPING AND ASSASSINATION ON 15 SEPTEMBER OF EDUARDO ANTONIO LOPEZ PALENCIA, A STUDENT WHOSE CORPSE SHOWED SIGNS OF TORTURE.",

WE MUST ALL UNITE TO ACHIEVE PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, ALWAYS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE SITUATION OUR COUNTRY IS GOING THROUGH.     WE MUST SUPPORT OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, OUR INSTITUTIONS, AND WE MUST TOTALLY REJECT THE FMLN TERRORIST FORCES.  WE MUST FACE THOSE FORCES THROUGH A UNITED FRONT.  WE CALL ON ALL OF OUR COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC AND POLITICAL FORCES TO FORM A UNITED FRONT; TO REJECT VIOLENCE AS A WAY OF SOLVING PROBLEMS IN EL SALVADOR; AND TO UNITE IN OUR ASPIRATION TO LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY AND IN PEACE, TRANQUILLITY, AND RESPECT FOR THE LAWS.  BRIEFLY, WE MUST UNITE TO LIVE IN A DE JURE STATE IN WHICH THE PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN HARMONY AND TRANQUILLITY.     IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY THAT ALL POLITICAL PARTIES JOIN EFFORTS, NOT AROUND A GOVERNMENT OR AN INSTITUTION, BUT FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE THEIR DEAREST GOALS.     WE ARE RECEIVING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S SUPPORT.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS SUPPORTING SALVADORAN DEMOCRACY.  WE HAVE RECEIVED ENCOURAGING MESSAGES FROM COUNTRIES SUCH AS GREAT BRITAIN, WHICH HAS VIGOROUSLY CONDEMNED THE FMLN TERRORIST ACTION.  WE HAVE RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM THE EEC, IN WHICH THAT GROUP IS TELLING THE FMLN THAT THE ARMED STRUGGLE IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS AND THAT TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS, WE MUST FIRST HAVE PEACE AND THEN ACHIEVE THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THOSE GOALS MUST BE ATTAINED THROUGH A PEACE PROCESS.  THE GOVERNMENT HAD ALREADY BEGAN THAT PROCESS AND THE FMLN TRIED TO BREAK IT.  THE PEACE PROCESS MUST BE BASED ON THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENT AND ESPECIALLY ON THE TELA AGREEMENT.     WE HAVE ALSO WITNESSED HOW DIFFERENT POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL TENDENCIES HAVE BECOME UNIFIED IN OTHER COUNTRIES.  [CONTINUED]",

PATRICIO AYLWIN HAS BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF CHILE. I CONGRATULATE HIM AND HIS FOLLOWERS, AND I WISH HIM SUCCESS IN HIS GOVERNMENT, FOR THE GOOD OF CHILE AND CHILEANS. HIS TRIUMPH IS NOT A DEFEAT FOR OUR IDEAS. MY CAMPAIGN WAS CONSTANTLY FOCUSED ON THE IDEA OF FREEDOM -- BOTH POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC -- PRIVATE PROPERTY, AND THE SOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY.  IT HAD TO BE THIS WAY BECAUSE THIS IS THE FUTURE CHILEANS WANT, AND IF OUR IDEAS GAIN GROUND, THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE NAME OF THE MAN CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING THEM.     BUT THOSE IDEAS MUST BE DISSEMINATED EVEN MORE WITH INCESSANT WORK. IN A DEMOCRACY, THE OPPOSITION ALSO GOVERNS.  HISTORY HAS PLACED US IN THE CONSTRUCTIVE OPPOSITION FOR THE NEXT 4 YEARS. WE WILL BE WILLING TO COOPERATE FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY, BUT WE WILL STAY ALERT TO DEFEND OUR VISION OF THE FUTURE. I AM CONVINCED THAT AN INTELLIGENT OPPOSITION CAN DO MUCH FOR THE COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY IF THAT OPPOSITION IS BACKED BY THE NEARLY 2 MILLION PEOPLE WHO TODAY SUPPORTED MY CANDIDACY.     THE WORK THAT LIES AHEAD WILL TO A LARGE EXTENT BE CARRIED OUT IN CONGRESS. THE INFORMATION NOW AVAILABLE SUGGESTS THAT THE PACT FOR DEMOCRACY AND PROGRESS HAS GAINED A VALUABLE REPRESENTATION IN BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS. LET MY CONGRATULATIONS GO TO THE FUTURE DEPUTIES AND SENATORS OF DEMOCRACY AND PROGRESS. I SEIZE THIS OCCASION TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY CAN COUNT ON MY SUPPORT.     I AM SATISFIED WITH THE NUMBER OF VOTES I WON, CONSIDERING THE UNFAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES. I AM SATISFIED WITH THE ENTHUSIASTIC AND GENEROUS WORK CARRIED OUT BY MY ELECTORAL STAFF AND BY THE POLITICAL PARTIES.  I THANK THEM FOR THEIR SUPPORT.  I WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK EACH OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO VOTED FOR ME. TO THE MILLIONS OF CHILEAN MEN AND WOMEN WHO IN SUNSHINE OR RAIN THROUGHOUT CHILE FILLED UP STADIUMS, PLAZAS, AND STREETS, CHANTING OUT SLOGANS FOR THE FUTURE; TO THOSE WHO SAW THE STREET WITH THE SYMBOL OF THE STAR OF HOPE; TO THOSE WHO PASTED MY PICTURE ON WALLS, WINDOWS, AND NOTEBOOKS; TO THOSE WHO ENCOURAGED ME IN THIS TIRESOME BUT MOVING CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBRACE, A HANDSHAKE, OR A SMILE; TO ALL THOSE I WANT TO EXPRESS MY DEEPEST THANKS.  I WILL KEEP THEM IN MY HEART FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.     WHEN WE INITIATED THIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN -- AN HONOR THAT YOU KNOW I NEVER SOUGHT -- I TOLD MY FOLLOWERS THAT JUST LIKE CLIMBING A MOUNTAIN, THERE WERE MOMENTS OF ADVANCE, FATIGUE, AND FALLS, BUT I TRUSTED THAT, MUSTERING ALL OUR ENERGY, WE WOULD OUTDO OURSELVES AND REACH THE SUMMIT. I AM SATISFIED BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT EACH ONE OF US, AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A POLITICAL FORCE, HAVE OUTDONE OURSELVES AND CLIMBED A LON WAY UP THE MOUNTAIN, BATTLING FOR OUR IDEAS AND FOR VOTES. WE DID NOT REACH THE SUMMIT, TRUE, BUT THIS MUST NOT DISMAY US. TODAY WE ARE CLOSER TO THE SUMMIT THAN WHEN WE STARTED.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYONE. GOOD NIGHT.",

AT THIS TIME, I WISH TO EXPRESS THE FEELINGS OF EACH AND EVERY MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES, OF THE INSTITUTION THAT AT THIS MOMENT IS BEING INSTITUTIONALLY CHALLENGED.  WE, AS SOLDIERS BORN OF THIS PEOPLE TO SERVE THIS PEOPLE, EXPRESS OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THAT MESSAGE OF CONFIDENCE, SECURITY, AND HOPE SENT BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC.

WE SAY: SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THIS INSTITUTION -- YOUR ARMED FORCES -- IS AT YOUR SIDE.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE WILLING TO SHED THEIR BLOOD AND GIVE THEIR LIVES PRECISELY SO THAT THE CHILDREN OF OUR PEOPLE, SO THAT THE CHILDREN OF OUR CHILDREN, CAN ASPIRE TO A WORTHY, FREE, JUST, AND INDEPENDENT LIFE.

WE WISH TO CONGRATULATE ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE BECAUSE, WITH THEIR WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT SENT TO US THROUGH DIFFERENT MEANS, THE INSTITUTION FEELS STRONGER AND MORE WILLING TO DEFEND THE REAL ASPIRATIONS OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.

IF THE COLLEAGUES AT THE CENTRAL STUDIO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE BOGOTA ELECTRICAL ENERGY INSTITUTE EMPLOYEE WHO WAS AT THE SITE OF THE INCIDENT.  WE ARE OBSERVING A TERRIBLE SCENE OF DESOLATION AND DEATH BECAUSE ALL THE PASSANGERS GOING TO CALI, VALLE DEL CAUCA DEPARTMENT, DIED.  THERE IS NO SINGLE SURVIVOR ACCORDING TO NATIONAL POLICE REPORTS.  THEY ARE AWAITING CRIMINAL INSTRUCTION JUDGES.  HOWEVER, THE ELECTRICITY COMPANY WORKER MAY ANSWER QUESTIONS POSED BY STUDIO REPORTERS.  LATER ON WE WILL HAVE MORE OFFICIAL INFORMATION.     [STUDIO REPORTER] CAN YOU CONFIRM THE ARRIVAL OF THE POLICE'S BOMB SQUAD?  AUTHORITIES FEAR THE CRASH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY AN EXPLOSION RATHER THAN AN ACCIDENT INSIDE THE AIRPLANE.     [REPORTER] THE F-2 JUDICIAL POLICE AND CRIMINAL STATISTICS EXPERTS ARE HERE.  THEY FEEL THAT THE ACCIDENT MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A TERRORIST ACTION.  THE REMARK WAS MADE BASED ON WITNESS ACCOUNTS. THEY NOTED THAT THIS MAY HAVE BEEN A TERRORIST ATTACK BECAUSE AIRPLANES DO NOT HAVE THIS KIND OF ACCIDENT UNLESS THERE IS AN EXPLOSION, SOMETHING THAT HAS VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.  ACCORDING TO REPORTS BY THE NATIONAL POLICE F-2 EXPERTS, THE AIRPLANE BROKE INTO SIX PIECES.  IT IS COMPLETELY DESTROYED, WHICH IS WHY THE 106 PASSENGERS ABOARD ARE STREWN ACROSS AN AREA 6-8 KM WIDE.     ACCESS TO THE AIRPLANE'S REMAINS IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THIS IS A MOUNTAINOUS REGION.  THE CASQUITO [WORD INDISTINCT] IS THROUGH THE ROAD THAT GOES FROM BOSA, CUNDINAMARCA DEPARTMENT, TO THE SCHOOL [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED].  AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THIS AREA IS LOCATED VERY CLOSE TO SLUICE NUMBER 3, MUNA 3, WHICH FEEDS WATER TO THE DAM.  THE SITUATION IS VERY DIFFICULT AND DRAMATIC.  RIGHT NOW, EXPERTS ARE COLLECTING SAMPLES AND TRYING FIND ALL THEY CAN TO LEARN FOR SURE IF THIS WAS A TERRORIST ACTION OR A SERIOUS ACCIDENT CAUSED BY A FLAW IN THE MECHANICAL SYSTEM OF THE HK-1803 AIRPLANE.",

THE AUTHORITIES REPORTED THAT AVELLO IS WANTED BY A U.S.  COURT FOR COMMITING MANY CRIMES, INCLUDING CONSPIRACY AND COMPLICITY IN CRIMES AGAINST THE U.S. ECONOMY.

THE COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES ALSO REPORTED THAT EMILIO REYNOSA AGUILAR WAS EXPELLED YESTERDAY FROM THE COUNTRY. HE IS WANTED BY THE PERUVIAN COURTS, AND THERE WAS ALSO A REQUEST FOR HIS EXTRADITION.  HOWEVER, THE COLOMBIAN AND PERUVIAN GOVERNMENTS AGREED THAT IT WAS BEST TO EXPEL REYNOSA AGUILAR FROM COLOMBIA. HE IS WANTED BY TWO LIMA COURTS FOR HELPING PRISONERS ESCAPE AND FOR OTHER CRIMES.     ON 6 SEPTEMBER, PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS EXTRADITED ECONOMIST EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO TO A COURT IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA.

LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT RICARDO VALDIVIESO AND VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT FRANCISCO MERINO ALSO DECLARED THAT THE DEATH OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS CAUSED BY WHAT VALDIVIESO TERMED THE GUERRILLAS' \"IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE.\"     GARCIA ALVARADO, 56, WAS KILLED WHEN A BOMB PLACED BY URBAN GUERRILLAS ON HIS VEHICLE EXPLODED AS IT CAME TO A HALT AT AN INTERSECTION IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR.     \"WE HAVE TO CONDEMN THIS INCIDENT, IT IS A GUERRILLA ACT,\" ALFREDO CRISTIANI, NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE (ARENA) PRESIDENT-ELECT, WHO WILL REPLACE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRAT JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE ON 1 JUNE, STATED.     CRISTIANI SAID THAT \"THESE ARE THE RISKS FACED BY SOMEONE WHO ENFORCES THE LAW.\"  HE NOTED THAT \"THE GUERRILLAS' IRRATIONAL ATTITUDE MAKES IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THEY WANT PEACE.\"     ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE BECAUSE ATTORNEY GENERAL GARCIA ALVARADO WARNED THAT \"HE WOULD TAKE MEASURES AGAINST URBAN TERRORISTS.\"     VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT FRANCISCO MERINO SAID THAT WHEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S CAR STOPPED AT A LIGHT ON A STREET IN DOWNTOWN SAN SALVADOR, AN INDIVIDUAL PLACED A BOMB ON THE ROOF OF THE ARMORED VEHICLE.     \"THE DRIVER TOLD THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ABOUT THE BOMB.  THE VEHICLE SWERVED AND THE BOMB EXPLODED, CAUSING THE TOP OF THE VEHICLE TO COLLAPSE ON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S HEAD,\" MERINO STATED.     GUERRILLAS ATTACKED MERINO'S HOME IN SAN SALVADOR 5 DAYS AGO WITH EXPLOSIVES.  THERE WERE SEVEN CHILDREN, INCLUDING FOUR OF THE VICE PRESIDENT'S CHILDREN, IN THE HOME AT THE TIME.  A 15-YEAR-OLD NIECE OF MERINO'S WAS INJURED.     \"THESE INCIDENTS,\" CRISTIANI SAID, \"FRANKLY CAUSE US TO BECOME MORE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT WE MUST NOT PERMIT TERRORIST ACTIONS TO OCCUR IN EL SALVADOR.\"     THE PRESIDENT-ELECT RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THESE ATTACKS \"WILL PREVENT THE INAUGURAL CEREMONY FROM TAKING PLACE.\"     \"I AM CERTAIN THAT THE INAUGURATION WILL BE ON 1 JUNE.  WE WILL NOT JUMP OVERBOARD OR MAKE A RUN FOR IT.  WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE UP AGAINST AND WILL GO ON,\" HE STATED.     CRISTIANI SAID THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS ARE INTENDED TO PROMPT A GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY REACTION SO THE FMLN CAN \"EXPLOIT IT\" ABROAD TO \"POLITICALLY ISOLATE THE NEW GOVERNMENT.\"     RICARDO VALDIVIESO, PRESIDENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSSEMBLY AND AN ARENA LEADER, SAID THE FMLN AND ITS \"FRONT\" GROUPS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE \"IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE THAT KILLED ATTORNEY GENERAL GARCIA.\"     VALDIVIESO SAID THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY WILL APPROVE DRASTIC LAWS TO \"HALT THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE.\"  HE SAID THE ATTORNEY GENERAL \"WAS APOLITICAL, WORKED FOR JUSTICE, AND DID NOT DESERVE TO DIE LIKE THAT.\"     ACCORDING TO THE POLICE AND GARCIA ALVARADO'S DRIVER, WHO ESCAPED UNSCATHED, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS TRAVELING WITH TWO BODYGUARDS. ONE OF THEM WAS INJURED.     THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S BODY WAS DESTROYED BY THE BOMB THAT EXPLODED OVER HIS HEAD.     NO GROUP HAS CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE ATTACK YET, BUT POLICE SOURCES CLAIM IT \"IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE FMLN URBAN COMMANDOS.\"     THE SAME SOURCES CONFIRMED THAT GARCIA ALVARADO HAD BEEN THREATENED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BY SALVADORAN URBAN GUERRILLAS.     MOMENTS AFTER THE ATTACK, ARMY AND POLICE UNITS CORDONED OFF THE AREA AND BEGAN AN ALL-OUT MILITARY OPERATION TO FIND THOSE RESPONSIBLE.     GARCIA ALVARADO, FATHER OF SIX, WAS APPOINTED ATTORNEY GENERAL ON 23 DECEMBER 1988.  HE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE CLOSELY LINKED TO ARENA. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, HOWEVER, HE SAID HE DID NOT REPRESENT ANY PARTY AND WAS CARRYING OUT HIS JOB \"IMPARTIALLY AND WITH THE INTENTION OF ENFORCING THE COUNTRY'S LAWS.\"",

HERE IS A REPORT BY OUR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT NATAN GUTMAN:     [BEGIN RECORDING] THE WEEKLY CABINET SESSION DEALT WITH THE COLOMBIA ISSUE ONLY BRIEFLY.  DEFENSE MINISTER YITZHAQ RABIN BRIEFLY REFERRED TO THE ISSUE MAINLY BECAUSE HE WAS ASKED BY OTHER MINISTERS TO DO SO.  DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER YITZHAQ NAVON SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT MUST PUT AN END TO THE DISGRACE CAUSED BY SOME ISRAELIS. DEFENSE MINISTER RABIN MERELY STATED THAT THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THE INVOLVEMENT OF ISRAELIS IN COLOMBIA IS UNDER INVESTIGATION.  DEFENSE ELEMENTS MADE CLEAR AT THE MEETING THAT SINCE 1986 THERE HAS BEEN A NEED TO ACQUIRE A SPECIFIC PERMIT FOR ANY SECURITY ACTIVITY BY AN ISRAELI BODY ABROAD.  IT WAS FURTHER MADE CLEAR THAT THE HOD HAHANIT [SPEARHEAD] COMPANY DID NOT HAVE SUCH A PERMIT, AND HAS BEEN WARNED NOT TO OPERATE IN COLOMBIA.     AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SESSION, CABINET SECRETARY ELYAQIM RUBINSTEIN SAID THAT THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT DISASSOCIATES ITSELF FROM ANY SUCH ACTIVITY.  IT WAS FURTHER STRESSED THAT ISRAEL CONSIDERS THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE PLAGUE OF INTERNATIONAL DRUGS A VERY IMPORTANT QUEST.

[BEGIN RECORDING] [ESTRADA] I BELIEVE IT IS INCOMPLETE BECAUSE WE DO NOT YET KNOW WHO COMMITTED THE CRIMES.

[REPORTER] DID YOU KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS GOING TO MAKE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT LAST NIGHT, OR WAS IT A SURPRISE?

THEY PROMISED US THAT IF WE WERE TO COOPERATE BY PROVIDING INFORMATION, THEY WOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM AND CARRY OUT THE INVESTIGATIONS.

I BELIEVE THAT A CRIME SUCH AS THE ONE BEING INVESTIGATED GOES AGAINST THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE ARMED FORCES, WHICH EXISTS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS, NOT TO HARM THEM.

B.  IN ORDER TO HOLD GOOD NEGOTIATIONS, WE FEEL IT IS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH IMMEDIATE GUARANTEES FOR THE RESPECT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS, AND POLITICAL AND SOCIAL GROUPS THROUGH:        1.  LIFTING OF THE STATE OF SIEGE AND REPEAL OF THE LAW ON REFO THE PENAL CODES, ALSO KNOWN AS THE ANTITERRORIST LAW THAT WAS RECENTLY APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY.        2.  RELEASE OF ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS.        3.  ALLOWED DEPARTURE OF FMLN WAR DISABLED AND MEDICAL TREATMEN FMLN WOUNDED.        4.  IMMEDIATE DISMISSAL OF THE FOLLOWING COMMANDERS AND OFFICER COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINTS CHIEFS OF STAFF, FOR HIS RESPONSIBILITY IN DECISIONS MADE BY THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND TO CARRY OUT INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION AND THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS; GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLOS, GENERAL RAFAEL ANTONIO VILLAMARIONA, AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL JUAN ANTONIO MARTINEZ VARELA, COMMANDER AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE AIR FORCE, FOR THEIR DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY IN THE BOMBINGS OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION; COLONEL ORLANDO ZEPEDA, DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER, FOR HAVING SIGNED THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS; COLONEL HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE TREASURY POLICE, WHICH IS THE CORPS THAT CARRIED OUT THE MURDERS; AND CAPTAIN ALFONSO CHAVEZ GARCIA, WHO WAS THE DIRECT PERPETRATOR OF THESE MURDERS.

YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE SO THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS WILL PREVAIL OVER WAR AND THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PROCESS WILL YIELD SPECIFIC RESULTS.

THE ATTACK RESULTED IN 9 INDIAN PEASANTS KILLED AND 3 WOUNDED, INCLUDING A 17-YEAR-OLD.     ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE COBAN FIRE DEPARTMENT, THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE WHEN A PAC PATROL WAS COMBING THE AREA FOR A REBEL COLUMN THAT HAD BEEN SEEN IN \"LA PROVIDENCIA\" FARMING COMMUNITY AREA.

THE SOLDIERS, HOWEVER, REALIZED THEIR MISTAKE ONLY AFTER NINE CIVILIANS HAD BEEN KILLED.     GUATEMALAN DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL HECTOR ALEJANDRO GRAMAJO WAS QUERIED ABOUT THE INCIDENT. HE SAID IT WAS CAUSED BY \"REGRETTABLE CONFUSION\" AND THAT AN ARMY COMMAND STAFF COMMISSION HAD ALREADY BEEN SENT TO INVESTIGATE IT.     GRAMAJO SAID THE COMMISSION IS TO ESTABLISH HOW THE INCIDENT OCCURRED, BUT ADMITTED THAT INITIAL REPORTS INDICATE THAT THERE HAD BEEN CONFUSION BETWEEN ARMY AND PAC UNITS.

HOWEVER, THE EMBASSY CONTINUES TO BE OCCUPIED BY APPROXIMATELY 50 DEMONSTRATORS.     AMBASSADOR JESUS FERNANDEZ AND ANOTHER TWO DIPLOMATS, AS WELL AS THREE SALVADORAN TELEVISION JOURNALISTS, ARE STILL BEING HELD HOSTAGE.

THERE WAS A TRIUMPHANT PRESENTATION OF AN OFFER TO REDUCE A COUNTRY'S DEBT BY UP TO 20 PERCENT, BUT AS FAR AS WE KNOW THAT OFFER HAS NOT MATERIALIZED.  FURTHERMORE, A 20-PERCENT REDUCTION IS NOT SIGNIFICANT, NOT GREAT ENOUGH TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF POVERTY AND THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS OF LATIN AMERICA.  THE REDUCTION MUST BE MUCH GREATER.  A REDUCTION OF 10 OR 20 PERCENT WILL DO LITTLE; EVERYTHING WILL REMAIN THE SAME.  WE BELIEVE -- AND I HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS TO EVERY LATIN AMERICAN PRESIDENT -- THAT ONLY THROUGH OUR ADOPTION OF FIRM AND DIGNIFIED POSITIONS WILL THE ADVERSARY RELENT.  [PASSAGE OMITTED]     [GARCIA] LET ME NOW SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT A DIFFERENT SUBJECT, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA. I BELIEVE THE OPPOSITION HAS RAISED A TEMPEST IN A TEACUP; IT HAS RAISED AN ISSUE THAT IS OF NO RELEVANCE TO THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE.  FIRST, WE UPHOLD THE CONCEPT OF UNIVERSALITY OF RELATIONS, OF MAINTAINING RELATIONS WITH ALL NATIONS. COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO ESTABLISHED RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA A FEW MONTHS AGO; HE DID NOT HAVE TO FACE A SAVAGE OPPOSITION TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS THROWING HIMSELF INTO THE ARMS OF TERRORISM. NOBODY HAS COMPLAINED TO CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ OR TO SALINAS DE GORTARI ABOUT MAINTAINING RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA.  FOR THAT MATTER, NOBODY HAS OBJECTED IN BOLIVIA, AUSTRIA, OR SWEDEN, BECAUSE IN THOSE COUNTRIES THERE IS NO REACTIONARY RIGHT TO ARGUE THAT TO RECOGNIZE NORTH KOREA IS TO COURT DESTRUCTION.     SECOND, SOMEONE -- AND I DO NOT WANT TO MENTION HIM BY NAME -- HAS SAID THAT RELATIONS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED WITH A TERRORIST STATE. THIS IS A TREMENDOUS ERROR, BECAUSE 20,000 RIFLES SOLD TO US BY NORTH KOREA AT $90 APIECE -- $10 LESS THAN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD -- HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO SAVE AND DEFEND THE LIVES OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CIVILIAN GUARDS FROM THE NATIONAL POLICE AND HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO ELIMINATE AND ERADICATE SUBVERSION IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.     THIRD, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO BE AUCTIONED OFF TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.  IF SO WE WOULD HAVE TO BREAK RELATIONS WITH AUSTRALIA OR WITH FINLAND.  ONE MUST MAINTAIN RELATIONS WITH ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD.  UNDER SUCH CRITERIA, SINCE PERU RECOGNIZES THE FRG, IT SHOULD CLOSE ITS EMBASSY IN THE COMMUNIST GDR.  THIS MANICHEAN CRITERION, THIS OBTUSE CRITERION, THIS OUTMODED CRITERION IS NO LONGER VALID; THE BERLIN WALL HAS BEEN RAZED.  HOW CAN ONE SAY THAT THIS COUNTRY SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AND ANOTHER SHOULDN'T?  PERU WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY IMPERIALIST VETO ON ITS WORLD RELATIONS.  WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THE 1960'S AND 1970'S WHEN PASSPORTS SAID WE COULD NOT TRAVEL TO THE SOVIET UNION OR CUBA.  PERUVIANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO TRAVEL WHEREVER THEY WISH, LIKE THEY WISH, AND WHEN THEY WISH.  THIS IS FREEDOM, AND IT CANNOT BE CURTAILED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OFF-LIMITS AREAS AROUND THE GLOBE.     FINALLY, SEVERAL OF THE GENTLEMEN WHO NOW OPPOSE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA HAVE BEEN HONORED, ILLUSTRIOUS GUESTS OF THE NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT.  THE OTHER DAY I HEARD SOME PEOPLE SPEAKING VEHEMENTLY ON THIS TOPIC, WHILE SOME OTHER PEOPLE NEARBY HAD BEEN HONORED GUESTS THERE.  JOURNALISTS CAN SEEK OUT AND DETERMINE HOW MANY OF THOSE WHO NOW OPPOSE THESE RELATIONS HAVE BEEN HONORED GUESTS IN NORTH KOREA FOR WEEKS.  NOW, FOR POLITICAL REASONS, THEY ARE OPPOSED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA. [END RECORDING]",

ROSA CHAVEZ SAID IN HIS SUNDAY HOMILY THAT \"THIS HAS AUGMENTED THE POSSIBILITIES FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO RECOVER THEIR TRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT'S INSTITUTIONS.\"     NEVERTHELESS, IN A STATEMENT GIVEN LATER TO THE MEDIA, THE AUXILIARY BISHOP EMPHASIZED THAT THE IMPLICATED MILITARY \"DO NOT REPRESENT ISOLATED CASES OF PERSONS WHO VIOLATED THE NORMS OF AN INSTITUTION, BUT ARE ACTUALLY PART OF A FORMATION AND THOUGHT SCHEME ACCORDING TO WHICH THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS SOMETHING SUBVERSIVE.\"     ACCORDING TO ROSA CHAVEZ, \"THE MILITARY WORLD WRONGLY UNDERSTANDS THE CHURCH'S MISSION IN THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS.\"     \"ASKED ABOUT EVENTUAL RESPONSIBILITIES NOT SPECIFIED BY THE PRESIDENT, ROSA CHAVEZ ANSWERED: \"THIS GRAVE ACTION IS THE RESULT OF A CONSPIRACY--AT LEAST A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE.\"     HE EMPHASIZED THAT, CONSEQUENTLY, THE STEP TAKEN YESTERDAY BY THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT \"IS VERY IMPORTANT, EVEN IF IT IS NOT THE LAST ONE.\"     THE BISHOP RECALLED THAT THIS YEAR IS THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO'S ASSASSINATION, \"WHICH HAS YET TO BE SOLVED,\" AND ASKED THE GOVERNMENT TO CARRY OUT \"ALL THE LEGAL ACTIONS TO INVESTIGATE THE CASES OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS WHOSE LIVES WERE TAKEN BY GUERRILLA GROUPS OR THE ARMY.\"     ROSA CHAVEZ SAID THAT THE CHURCH FULLY AGREES THAT THE CRIMES OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED \"WITH THE SAME ZEAL\" WITH WHICH THE JESUIT PRIESTS' SLAYING HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED.     \"HOWEVER, WE HAVE ASKED THAT THE INVESTIGATION BE EXHAUSTIVELY AND THOROUGHLY CARRIED OUT WITHOUT GIVING IT A PROPAGANDISTIC APPEARANCE,\" HE ADDED.     THE BISHOP EMPHASIZED THAT THE TWO IDEOLOGIES CONFRONTING EACH OTHER IN EL SALVADOR EQUALLY DISDAIN HUMAN RIGHTS.     \"MARXISM IS THE ROOT OF THE FMLN'S ABUSE AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY DOCTRINE REPRESENTS THE BASIS OF THE ARMED FORCES' UNACCEPTABLE REPRESSION,\" HE SAID.",

WITH THIS VERSION, CRISTIANI AND THE HIGH COMMAND ARE TRYING TO COME UP WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE TRIAL AND TO PLACE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUITS ON MID-LEVEL MILITARY OFFICERS.  THE COLONELS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE CRIME COULD BE SET FREE AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY WOULD ONLY BE RELATED TO THE FACT THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED WITHIN AN AREA UNDER THEIR COMMAND.     THIS VERSION OF THE CRIME IS AIMED AT LEAVING THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND FREE FROM ANY RESPONSIBILITY AND TO ONLY SLIGHTLY TOUCH THE MEMBERS OF LA TANDONA, ESPECIALLY COL ORLANDO CEPEDA, WHO WAS THE ONE WHO SIGNED THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE THE JESUITS, AND COL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHIEF OF STAFF.  COL GUILLERMO BENAVIDES, WHO IS A MEMBER OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE WITHIN LA TANDONA, WAS INDIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE CRIME.     HOWEVER, THE [WORD INDISTINCT] IS SELF-EVIDENT.  THE DECISION TO CARRY OUT AN OPERATION TO KILL POPULAR AND RELIGIOUS DEMOCRATIC LEADERS WAS MADE BY THE GENERAL STAFF OF THE ARMED FORCES [WORDS INDISTINCT] 4 DAYS AFTER THE FMLN OFFENSIVE BEGAN.  THIS OPERATION WAS PART OF A COMPLETE COUNTEROFFENSIVE PLAN OF THE ARMED FORCES, WHICH INCLUDED THE MASSIVE USE OF ALL THE FIREPOWER OF THE AIR FORCE AGAINST POOR NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE KILLING OF DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT AND CHURCH LEADERS.     ALFREDO CRISTIANI, WHO WAS TAKEN TO THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE GENERAL STAFF FOR SECURITY REASONS AND ASSUMED CONTROL OF THE DEFENSE PLAN, WAS FULLY AWARE OF THE GENOCIDE PLAN.  U.S. OFFICERS AND ADVISERS WERE ALSO AT THE GENERAL STAFF HEADQUARTERS AT THE TIME TO DISCUSS AND APPROVE THIS GENOCIDE PLAN.     THE PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED ON THE EVENING OF 16 NOVEMBER.  ALL LABOR UNION OFFICES IN SAN SALVADOR WERE LOOTED.  THE OFFICES OF HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATIONS, POLITICAL PARTIES, AND RELIGIOUS CENTERS WERE ALSO LOOTED.     THE PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED AT THE INSTALLATIONS OF THE UCA.  THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED SAW A CONTINUATION OF THE ARRESTS, PERSECUTIONS, AND ASSASSINATIONS.  THE OFFICES OF ALL THE [WORDS INDISTINCT] WERE ATTACKED.  ITS LEADERS WERE FORCED TO SEEK REFUGE OR TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY TO ESCAPE THIS MANHUNT.  THIS IS A POLICY FOR WHICH THE HIGH COMMAND AND ALFREDO CRISTIANI ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE U.S.  AMBASSADOR AND U.S. EMBASSY PERSONNEL ARE FULLY AWARE OF THIS.     THE NEED TO COME UP WITH THIS VERSION COMES FROM THE PRECARIOUS PREDICAMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES IN IN VIEW OF THE DEBATES TAKING PLACE IN THE U.S. CONGRESS TO DECIDE THE FATE OF AID TO EL SALVADOR, WHICH IS LINKED TO THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THE ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS ON 16 NOVEMBER.",

THE REPORT STATES THAT DURING TODAY'S CLASHES IN CIUDAD DELGADO, LOS ALPES, GUADALUPE, AND SAN PATRICIO NEIGHBORHOODS, THE TREASURY POLICE SUFFERED THREE CASUALTIES.  WE INFLICTED TWO CASUALTIES ON THE TREASURY POLICE IN LOS ALPES NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THE 6TH MILITARY DETACHMENT SUFFERED ONE CASUALTY DURING A CLASH IN SAN PATRICIO NEIGHBORHOOD.

GUATEMALA, LIKE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT BENEFIT FROM THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT, ARE FACING THE PROBLEM OF NOT BEING ABLE TO HONOR ALL COMMITMENTS ON DEBTS AS THEY MATURE.  THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT WAS ONE OF THE POINTS DISCUSSED BY PRESIDENT CEREZO DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE TODAY AT THE AYACUCHO ROOM OF THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [CEREZO] WE HAVE PROPOSED A 20-YEAR TERM TO RESTRUCTURE THE DEBT, WITH A SIX-YEAR GRACE PERIOD, AT FOUR PERCENT INTEREST.  OBVIOUSLY, THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE USUAL PROCEDURE AT THE VENEZUELAN INVESTMENT FUND NOR IS THIS INCLUDED IN THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT.  FOR THESE REASONS, BECAUSE THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT FIT VENEZUELAN LAW, WE NEED TO DISCUSS AND ADJUST THE TERMS TO THE LAW AND THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENT.  HOWEVER, THERE IS WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS THE TERMS.  WE WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO MAKE THE SAME PROPOSAL TO THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT, FROM WHOM WE EXPECT THE SAME ATTITUDE AND UNDERSTANDING, AND WE ARE CERTAIN WE WILL HAVE IT. [END RECORDING]     WITHIN THE FORMAL CEREZO VISIT, TWO IMPORTANT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN VENEZUELA AND GUATEMALA WERE SIGNED TODAY.  ONE OF THEM IS A COOPERATION AND FRIENDSHIP AGREEMENT.  ANOTHER IS A SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL COOPERATION AGREEMENT IN ENERGY AND MINING MATTERS, WHICH WILL STRENGTHEN BILATERAL RELATIONS.  AS ENERGY AND MINES MINISTER CELESTINO ARMAS SAID UPON SIGNING THE AGREEMENTS, THIS WILL PERMIT CARRYING OUT JOINT OIL EXPLORATION OPERATIONS.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [ARMAS] FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE AREA OF OIL EXPLORATION, THERE ARE VERY INTERESTING PROSPECTS IN GUATEMALA THAT COULD RESULT IN GREAT INTEREST FOR GUATEMALA AND FOR VENEZUELA.  WITH REGARD TO MINING, WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING SOME PROGRESS IN THE MINING SECTOR IN GUATEMALA AND THE POSSIBILITY OF HELPING GUATEMALA DISCOVER MINERAL DEPOSITS THAT COULD BE VERY ATTRACTIVE FOR OUR ECONOMIES. [END RECORDING]     FOLLOWING THE NEWS CONFERENCE HELD AT THE MIRAFLORES PALACE, GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO WENT TO THE CELA [ECONOMIC COMISSION FOR LATIN AMERICA].  THE CEREZO AGENDA INCLUDED A DINNER HE WILL HOST TONIGHT FOR HIS COUNTERPART CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ.",

HOWEVER, THE FIGHTERS FOR \"FREEDOM,\" \"DEMOCRACY,\" AND \"HUMAN RIGHTS\" IN WESTERN NATIONS HAVE KEPT QUIET OUT OF FEAR OF THE NAKED AGGRESSION AND THE WAY OF THE TYRANT.     ON 20 DECEMBER 1989, SEVERAL TENS OF THOUSANDS OF U.S.  TROOPS, EQUIPPED WITH THE MOST UP-TO-DATE WEAPONS, BRAZENLY INTRUDED INTO PANAMA, TOPPLING THE NORIEGA GOVERNMENT AND FORCING MANUEL ANTONIO NORIEGA TO BE TRIED IN THE UNITED STATES.  THIS U.S. ACT WAS BY NO MEANS LESS THAN THE SOVIET ACT OF INVADING CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND KIDNAPPING ITS LEADERS AT THAT TIME.  THE NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT ESTIMATED THAT THE U.S. INVASION HAD RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF AT LEAST 600 PANAMANIAN SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS AND MADE SEVERAL TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HOMELESS.  MORE THAN 5,000 MILITARY AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL OF THE FORMER GOVERNMENT WERE ARRESTED BY U.S. TROOPS, AND PANAMA SUFFERED ECONOMIC LOSSES OF $10 BILLION.  THE UNITED STATES OPENLY MANIPULATED THE WORK OF ESTABLISHING A NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, NATIONAL DEFENSE ARMY, POLICE FORCE, AND OTHER STATE APPARATUSES, SO MUCH SO THAT IT RUSHED IN AND RAIDED [AS PUBLISHED] THE EMBASSIES OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN PANAMA OR DIPLOMATIC APARTMENTS, AND DETAINED THE DIPLOMATIC OFFICIALS OF OTHER COUNTRIES. UNDER THE POWERFUL PRESSURE OF WORLD OPINION, SOME OF THE U.S. TROOPS HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM PANAMA, BUT THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT STILL REFUSES TO PULL OUT ALL ITS TROOPS.     JUST AFTER ITS INTRUSION INTO PANAMA, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IMMEDIATELY ANNOUNCED, AS SCHEDULED, THE DISPATCH OF A STRONG FLEET OF WARSHIPS INTO THE CARIBBEAN, CLOSE TO THE COAST OF COLOMBIA, FOR WHAT WAS CALLED AN ANTIDRUG MANEUVER, INTERCEPTING PLANES AND VESSELS FOR TRAFFICKING IN DRUGS.  ON 5 JANUARY THIS YEAR, THE UNITED STATES, IGNORING THE STRONG OPPOSITION OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS, ORDERED A FLEET OF FOUR WARSHIPS, INCLUDING THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER \"KENNEDY\" AND NUCLEAR-PROPELLED CRUISER \"VIRGINIA,\" TO SAIL TOWARD THE CARIBBEAN TO \"COMBAT DRUG SMUGGLING.\"  SUCH A HIGH-HANDED WAY OF IGNORING THE SOVEREIGNTY AND WILL OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS AND FORCING THE DEPLOYMENT OF TROOPS IN FRONT OF THE GATES OF OTHER COUNTRIES EVOKED FIERCE REACTIONS IN COLOMBIA AND OTHER LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS. JARAMILLO OSSA, A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FROM THE COLOMBIAN PATRIOTIC UNION, NOTED THAT THE UNITED STATES \"VERY NEARLY\" INVADED COLOMBIA. THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT ALSO WARNED THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT: WITHOUT THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT BARCO, NO U.S WARSHIPS ARE ALLOWED TO DRAW NEAR [AS PUBLISHED] THE WATERS OF COLOMBIA.  IT ALSO ORDERED ITS NAVAL AND AIR FORCES TO INTENSIFY THEIR SEA PATROLS TO SAFEGUARD THE COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE GOVERNMENTS OF COLOMBIA, VENEZUELA, AND SOME OTHER NATIONS REFUSED TO JOIN THE PROPOSED U.S. \"DRUG-FIGHTING DRILL\" IN THE CARIBBEAN.  FACED WITH SUCH A SITUATION, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAD TO ORDER THE \"DRUG-FIGHTING FLEET\" TO RETURN TO BASE AND CANCEL THE \"DRILL.\"     ON THE AFOREMENTIONED ACTS OF THE UNITED STATES, LEADERS OF SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS COMMENTED: WHILE RELAXING THE TENSION WITH THE SOVIET UNION, THE UNITED STATES HAS RESERVED THE \"RIGHT\" TO INTERFERE BY FORCE IN LATIN AMERICA AND OTHER SMALL AND WEAK COUNTRIES.  THE PUBLIC MEDIA OF SOME NATIONS SOLEMNLY POINTED OUT: SUCH MOVES OF U.S. AGGRESSION ARE THE CONTINUATION OF THE CONSISTENT U.S. POLICY OF INTERFERING IN THE AFFAIRS OF LATIN AMERICA AND ALSO THE EXTENSION OF WHAT IS CALLED THE REAGAN DOCTRINE, WHICH STARTED IN THE EARLY 1980'S.     IN U.S. RELATIONS WITH LATIN AMERICA THROUGHOUT THE DECADE OF THE 1980'S, THERE WAS A PROBLEM AFFECTING THE SITUATION AS A WHOLE, NAMELY, THE ISSUE OF CENTRAL AMERICA, WHICH HAD ALL ALONG BEEN LISTED IN THE CATEGORY OF EAST-WEST CONFRONTATION BY THE UNITED STATES.  THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION EVEN GAVE TOP PRIORITY TO MEETING THE CRISIS IN CENTRAL AMERICA IN ITS FOREIGN POLICY.     IN 1981, WHEN REAGAN ENTERED THE WHITE HOUSE, THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA STOOD AS FOLLOWS: THE SANDINISTA REVOLUTION HAD WON VICTORY IN NICARAGUA, THE GUERRILLA WAR IN EL SALVADOR WAS ESCALATING, AND A TURBULENT SITUATION HAD STARTED TO EMERGE IN OTHER CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES.  THE HUMAN RIGHTS DIPLOMACY PURSUED BY THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION RESULTED IN THE DETERIORATION OF U.S. RELATIONS WITH A CERTAIN NUMBER OF LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS RULED BY JUNTAS.  IN 1977 THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION SIGNED THE PANAMA CANAL TREATY WITH THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, AGREEING TO RETURN TO PANAMA SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE CANAL AND THE CANAL ZONE.  BEFORE THE VICTORY OF THE NICARAGUA REVOLUTION, IN 1979 THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION ABANDONED ITS SUPPORT FOR THE TYRANNICAL SOMOSA REGIME AND ESTABLISHED NORMAL RELATIONS WITH THE SANDINISTA REGIME.

AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAS BEEN COUNTERED BY THE ARMED FORCES IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND POSSESSIONS. THE SITUATION IS UNDER THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES' CONTROL.     THE FLMN, WITH A TOTAL DISREGARD FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, HAS UNLEASHED AN INDISCRIMINATE ATTACK ON VARIOUS PLACES IN SAN SALVADOR AND ON THE CAPITALS OF FOUR DEPARTMENTS BY FIRING VERY POWERFUL WEAPONS AND KILLING MANY CIVILIANS.     THE GOVERNMENT HEREBY REPORTS THESE TERRORIST ACTIONS BECAUSE THE FMLN ATTACKS ON MILITARY OBJECTIVES HAVE SERIOUSLY ENDANGERED THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS.     THIS FMLN ATTACK IS TOTALLY UNJUSTIFIED BECAUSE THE DIALOGUE PROCESS IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS ATTENDED THEM WITH TOTAL POLITICAL HONESTY, TRYING TO FIND MECHANISMS AND RATIONAL SOLUTIONS TO THE CONFLICT.  THE FMLN NOT ONLY HAS VIOLATED THE AGREEMENTS IT SIGNED IN MEXICO CITY, BUT ALSO IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA. IT HAS ALSO BRAZENLY MOCKED THE FEELINGS AND THE DESIRE FOR PEACE WANTED BY THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.     THE FMLN TERRORIST ACTIONS HAVE FORCED THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE USE OF ITS LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO DEFEND SOCIETY BY USING THE ARMED FORCES WHICH HAS BEEN FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE PEOPLE.  SALVADORAN PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO LOSE THEIR LIBERTY AND FALL INTO THE HANDS OF TOTALITARIAN MARXIST-LENINIST SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE ONE THE FMLN WANTS TO IMPOSE RUTHLESSLY.  REPRESENTATIVES FROM VARIOUS COUNTRIES WHO HAVE OBSERVED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE INCIDENTS CAN FULLY CONFIRM THE FACTS.  THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, IN ADDITION TO BEING VICTIMS OF THE FMLN AGGRESSION, FEEL OUTRAGED BECAUSE THE FMLN STILL HAS THE GALL TO SAY THAT IT IS SPEAKING IN DEFENSE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WHO, IN THESE SAD TIMES, FEEL OUTRAGED BY THE TERRORIST GROUP'S IRRATIONAL ATTACK.     THE GOVERMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR REQUESTS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CONDEMN THIS BRUTAL VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS PERPETRATED BY THE FMLN.  IT ALSO ASKS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO CONDEMN THE HIDEOUS CRIMES THE FMLN TROOPS ARE PERPETRATING AGAINST CIVILIANS -- WHO FLATLY REFUSE TO HELP THEM -- AND WHO HAVE REJECTED THEM [3 SECOND BREAK IN TRANSMISSION].  THE GOVERNMENT ALSO REQUESTS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY STRONGLY CONDEMN NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ORTEGA BECAUSE HE SUPPLIED THE WEAPONS THAT THE TERRORISTS ARE USING TO MASSACRE THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.",

THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION IN EAST EUROPE HAS ALSO BEEN A SENSATION TO CHILE.  WHAT HOPES DO YOU PLACE IN THESE GIGANTIC RADICAL CHANGES?     AYLWIN: I THINK THAT THE CHANGES IN EAST EUROPE ARE OF VERY GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR MANKIND.  THEY GIVE US SATISFACTION AND HOPE.  THE OPENING OF THE BERLIN WALL SYMBOLIZES THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA IN RELATIONS BETWEEN EAST AND WEST AS WELL AS THE DESIRE OF THE GERMANS TO ACHIEVE UNITY AGAIN.  WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS SITUATION LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN MILITARY SPENDING AND TO CLOSER RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PEOPLES.     DIE WELT: WHAT EFFECTS DO YOU SEE FOR A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY SUCH AS CHILE?     AYLWIN: I SEE TWO EFFECTS.  FIRST, A SYMBOLIC EFFECT.  CHILE IS TRADITIONALLY A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY.  NOW THE LONG PERIOD OF A DICTATORIAL REGIME IS ENDING, HOWEVER.  THIS EXPLOSION OF FREEDOM COINCIDES WITH THE RESTORATION OF DEMOCRACY IN CHILE.  THAT IS A STIMULATING FEELING.  WE ARE EMBARKING ON THE ROAD OF HUMANITY. SECOND, THERE IS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE DANGER OF COMMUNISM IN OUR COUNTRY; PEOPLE SAY THAT COMMUNISM COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR DEMOCRATIC FUTURE.  I THINK THAT THE EVENTS IN EAST EUROPE AND THE SOVIET UNION DEMONSTRATE THAT COMMUNISM IS NO LONGER A DANGER FOR THE WORLD.  NOR FOR CHILE.     DIE WELT: CHILE HAS THE BEST ORGANIZED COMMUNIST PARTY IN LATIN AMERICA.  HAS THIS PARTY CHANGED?  WHAT WAS ITS REACTION?     AYLWIN: LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SITUATION OF SUCH A MONOLITHIC AND COHERENT PARTY.  IT WAS ILLEGAL AND WORKED UNDERGROUND FOR A LONG TIME.  HOWEVER, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY COMMUNIST PARTY CAN IGNORE THE EVENTS IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD WHICH HAS SO FAR BEEN DOMINATED BY COMMUNIST PARTIES.  THE CHILEAN COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERS HAVE ADMITTED THAT THIS IS A UNIVERSAL PROCESS.     DIE WELT: WHAT RELATIONSHIP DO YOU HAVE WITH VOLODIA TEITELBOIM, THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY?  DO YOU SPEAK WITH HIM? DO YOU SEE HIM SOMETIMES?     AYLWIN: WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER FROM THE TIME WHEN WE WERE BOTH SENATORS, MEANING PRIOR TO 1973.  WE WERE POLITICAL OPPONENTS, BUT WE OFTEN TALKED WITH EACH OTHER.  SINCE THEN, WE HAVE MET ONLY ONCE, AT A POLITICAL FUNCTION.  MY RIVALS IN THIS ELECTION CAMPAIGN HAVE OFTEN MISREPRESENTED OUR RELATIONSHIP, AND HAVE DESCRIBED ME AS TEITELBOIM'S SECRET ALLY.  HOWEVER, I THINK THAT PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT PERSUASIONS CAN TALK WITH EACH OTHER AND CAN REACH AGREEMENT.  THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN CHILE WITH SOME SUCCESS.     DIE WELT: THE COMMUNIST PARTY BACKED YOUR CANDIDACY.  WILL IT BE REPRESENTED IN THE NEW GOVERNMENT?     AYLWIN: NOT AT ALL.     DIE WELT: BUT THE FUTURE GOVERNMENT WILL BE A LEFT-CENTER GOVERNMENT AND WILL REFLECT THE COMPOSITION OF THE OPPOSITION TODAY.     AYLWIN: YES, CHILE WILL HAVE A LEFT-CENTER GOVERNMENT.  THE VARIOUS SOCIALIST CURRENTS WILL BE REPRESENTED.  HOWEVER, THE STRONGEST MOVEMENT IS THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHICH IS IN THE CENTER.     DIE WELT: DO YOU THINK THAT FOLLOWING THESE ELECTIONS, THE PANORAMA OF THE OPPOSITION WILL CHANGE?     AYLWIN: I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.  THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR FAMILIES IN THE PAST -- THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC FAMILY, THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATICALLY-ORIENTED FAMILY OF THE OLD RADICAL PARTY, THE SOCIALIST FAMILY, AND THE FAMILY OF THE RIGHT CENTER.  THEY ALL WANT TO SURVIVE.     DIE WELT: MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT THE SOCIALIST RICARDO LAGOS IS THE STRONGEST FIGURE OF THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE.  WHAT ROLE WILL HE PLAY IN THE FUTURE?     AYLWIN: HE WILL CONCENTRATE ON PARLIAMENTARY WORK AS A SENATOR.  AS IS THE CASE IN EVERY PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY, HE CANNOT BE A MEMBER OF THE GOVERNMENT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF CONGRESS.

A PRESIDENTIAL PALACE SOURCE TOLD EFE THAT THE GUERRILLA REPRESENTATIVES DISCUSSED WITH PRESIDENT BARCO SOME OF THE ISSUES TO BE DEBATED AT THE \"WORKING ROUNDTABLES.\"  THE \"WORKING ROUNDTABLES\" COMPRISE DELEGATES OF THE GUERRILLAS, THE GOVERNMENT, AND THE POLITICAL PARTIES REPRESENTED IN THE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS, WHO WILL EXCHANGE VIEWS ON THE CHANGES THE COUNTRY NEEDS.     THE M-19 DELEGATES ARRIVED AT THE NARINO PALACE, LOCATED IN DOWNTOWN BOGOTA, UNDER STRICT SECURITY MEASURES AT 1800 LOCAL TIME (2300 GMT).     MEANWHILE, AT THE PEACE VILLAGE IN THE MOUNTAINS OF CAUCA DEPARTMENT, 350 KM SOUTHWEST OF BOGOTA, M-19 COMMANDER CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ RELEASED A COMMUNIQUE IN WHICH HE ACCUSED THE COLOMBIAN ARMY OF ATTACKING AN M-19 GROUP ON 26 MARCH.  ACCORDING TO PIZARRO, THE ATTACK WAS STAGED BY THE MILITARY TO \"CREATE OBSTACLES FOR THE PEACE PROCESS.\"  HE ADDED THAT COMMANDER MARCO CHALITA, COMMANDER OF THE M-19'S \"SOUTHERN FRONT,\" WAS SLIGHTLY INJURED IN THE FIGHTING.     ON 26 MARCH, 9TH BRIGADE TROOPS CLASHED WITH THE \"AMANDA RINCON\" GROUP, LED BY CHALITA, IN A RURAL AREA OF PITALITO MUNICIPALITY, HUILA DEPARTMENT.  DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL MANUEL JAIME GUERRERO PAZ DESCRIBED THE CLASH AS \"AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT.\"     PIZARRO SAID IN A COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AT THE PEACE VILLAGE TODAY THAT THE TROOPS ATTACKED THE REBELS AND THAT \"TWO OF OUR COMRADES WERE KILLED AND THREE OTHERS WOUNDED.\"     THE M-19 COMMANDER SAID \"HE SHARED THE DEFENSE MINISTER'S VIEWPOINT,\" AND HE SAID \"OBSTACLES STILL MUST BE OVERCOME\" TO ACHIEVE A NATIONAL RECONCILIATION.

[AZCONA] NO, THERE IS NO UNREST BECAUSE OF LAWS PASSED BY CONGRESS. SOME MEASURES THAT HAVE AFFECTED INCOME HAVE BEEN ADOPTED, BUT WE WILL MAKE PROGRESS ANYHOW.     [GIRON] WILL YOU ASK THAT SOME OF THESE LAWS BE RECONSIDERED?     [AZCONA] NO, I AM NOT GOING TO DO THAT.  THERE IS, HOWEVER, THE LAW ON COFFEE TAXES WHICH COULD BE DISCUSSED WITH PRODUCERS BECAUSE THE LAW-DECREE ON COFFEE IS VERY DRASTIC.  HOWEVER, THE COUNTRY IS MAKING PROGRESS, AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES IN VARIOUS SECTORS--COMMERCE, CONSTRUCTION, AND MANUFACTURING--ARE ON THE INCREASE.  SOME SECTORS HAVE SOME PROBLEMS, BUT I BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO RESOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS.     [GIRON] DO YOU HAVE ECONOMIC ADVISERS, MR PRESIDENT?     [AZCONA] ANY PERSON CONSULTED IS AN ECONOMIC ADVISER.  THE MAIN ECONOMIC ADVISERS, HOWEVER, ARE THOSE IN THE GOVERNMENT.     [GIRON] IT IS BEING SAID THAT POLITICALLY SPEAKING YOU HAVE BEEN LEFT ON YOUR OWN.  IS THIS HOW YOU SEE IT ALSO?     [AZCONA] NO WAY.  HOW COULD I BE ALONE? ON THE CONTRARY, WE ARE DOING WELL.  I BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO RECEIVE MORE SUPPORT.  I DO NOT SEE WHY I COULD BE LEFT ALONE.  THERE IS THE GOVERNMENT AND THE EXPERTS.  WE ARE ESTABLISHING RELATIONS WITH THE PARTY, WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE OF THE PARTY.     [GIRON] ARE EMPLOYEES GOING TO BE PRESSURED?

I THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENED WILL BENEFIT THE COUNTRY.  ACTS OF VIOLENCE ARE REGRETTABLE, BUT THOSE THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE HAVE SHOWN THAT WE IN HONDURAS ARE NOT IMMUNE TO VIOLENCE. THE SAME DAY INCIDENTS WERE TAKING PLACE HERE, 13 PERSONS DIED IN SAN SALVADOR AS A RESULT OF A BOMB EXPLOSION.  THE LOSS OF LIVES IS UNFORTUNATE AND VIOLENCE AGAINST A BUILDING AND FACILITIES NEXT TO THE U.S. EMBASSY IS REGRETTABLE BECAUSE THIS DOES NOT HELP THE COUNTRY.     [GIRON] HAVE YOU TALKED WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ABOUT AN INDEMNITY?  IT IS BEING SAID THAT DAMAGE AMOUNTS TO $6 MILLION.     [AZCONA] NO, WE HAVE NOTHING ABOUT $6 MILLION.  WHAT WE HAVE RECEIVED IS A NOTE FROM THE U.S. AMBASSADOR THE DAY AFTER THE INCIDENTS.  THEY ARE ENTITLED TO FILE A PROTEST.  THE NOTE SAYS THAT LATER THERE WILL BE A [WORDS INDISTINCT].     HONDURAS SIGNED THE GENEVA CONVENTION ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENTS WHEN ACTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT AGAINST DIPLOMATIC INSTALLATIONS.     [GIRON] THE FORCING OF RADIO STATIONS TO JOIN A RADIO NETWORK AND THE IMPOSING OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF MUCH CRITICISM AGAINST YOUR GOVERNMENT.     [AZCONA] I HAVE HEARD SOME CRITICISM BECAUSE OF THE NETWORK. PERHAPS WE HAD IT FOR A FEW HOURS TOO MANY.  REGARDING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, HOWEVER, THE PEOPLE HAVE RESPONDED POSITIVELY BECAUSE ONE MORE CASUALTY WOULD HAVE HAD NEGATIVE EFFECTS.  THE STATE OF EMERGENCY MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO COOL DOWN, AND THOSE ON THE STREETS RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES.  I FEEL IT WAS BENEFICIAL.  THE DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY DECREE WAS BASED ON THE CONSTITUTION AND ON PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY.  CONGRESS WAS INFORMED ABOUT THIS.     I BELIEVE THIS WAS A POSITIVE MEASURE, AND THIS IS HOW THE PEOPLE HAVE VIEWED IT, POSITIVELY.     [GIRON] DO YOU BELIEVE THE SITUATION HAS BEEN OVERCOME?     [AZCONA] WE DO NOT KNOW IF THE SITUATION IS OVER.  I THINK SO.  I BELIEVE THAT WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT TEMPERS GOT HOT FOR A MOMENT, AND THAT SOME SECTORS, WHICH I DO NOT WANT TO NAME BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE PEOPLE, TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS.  PERHAPS SOME PEOPLE TRIED TO MAKE POLITICAL GAINS AND THE SITUATION GOT OUT OF HAND.     I BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT EVERYTHING IS MORE OR LESS QUIET.  THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING WITH THE VARIOUS SECTORS.  THERE IS A SMALL STRIKE BY A SMALL GROUP OF HEALTH WORKERS.  CHECKS WITH SALARY INCREASES COVERING A 4-MONTH PERIOD WILL BE PAID TODAY.  SOME READJUSTMENTS WILL BE MADE TO FAVOR SOME EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE INCREASES WE HAD PROMISED.     WE WANT TO APPEAL TO HEALTH SECTOR LABOR UNIONS TO SET ASIDE ANY CONFRONTATIONAL ATTITUDE BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT IS MEETING AND WILL MEET ALL ITS COMMITMENTS.     [GIRON] WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE LATEST INCIDENTS WITH NICARAGUA?     [AZCONA] THESE ARE NOT THE FIRST INCIDENTS.  I BELIEVE INCIDENTS WILL CONTINUE HAPPENING.  HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT IS PREPARED TO ENFORCE RESPECT FOR THE COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY.  [END RECORDING]",

THIS VIOLENT, IRRATIONAL, ILLOGICAL, AND SENSELESS ACTION BEGAN 8 DAYS AGO AGAINST PEACE-LOVING PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WORK, CHOOSE THEIR OWN DESTINY, AND SEEK THEIR WELFARE.

THE FIRST THING THE GOVERNMENT DID WAS TO CONSOLIDATE ITS BASES TO WAGE A STRUGGLE AGAINST THOSE TERRORIST GROUPS WITH WHATEVER FIRMNESS AND PERSEVERANCE WAS CALLED FOR.     WE STRENGTHENED INVESTIGATION ORGANIZATIONS, WE CREATED SPECIAL PUBLIC COURTS.  WE MODIFIED PENAL LAWS AND PROCEDURES.

ONE CANNOT PROVIDE AN OVERNIGHT SOLUTION FOR THESE COMPLEX PROBLEMS WITH WHICH YOU ARE ALL VERY FAMILIAR.     ONCE THE INSTITUTIONS IN CHARGE OF MAINTAINING PUBLIC ORDER AND SECURITY WERE STRENGTHENED, WE CONCENTRATED OUR AVAILABLE RESOURCES ON SOLVING THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY THOSE TERRORIST GROUPS.  THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY POSITIVE, BOTH IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING -- WHICH IS THE CENTRAL FOCUS OF MANY OF THESE TERRORIST GROUPS -- AND IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST GANGS OF HIRED ASSASSINS AND PRIVATE JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS, ALSO KNOWN AS DEATH SQUADS.     NEVER BEFORE HAD WE ACHIEVED SUCH POSITIVE RESULTS.  I AM SURE THAT EVEN THOUGH WE WILL FACE DIFFICULTIES AND OBSTACLES, WE WILL CONTINUE TO WIN THIS BATTLE AGAINST TERRORISM.

HE ADDED THAT ONE OF THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES HIT A WALL OF THE AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS AND THE SHOCK WAVE FROM THE EXPLOSION DAMAGED SOME BUILDINGS.

THE TERRORIST ACTIONS SEEM TO BE MOTIVATED BY THE FACT THAT THE IRREGULAR GROUPS ARE SHRINKING CONSIDERABLY.  EVIDENCE OF THIS IS THE FACT THAT A SUBVERSIVE WHO SURRENDERED ON THE SOUTHERN COAST WAS CARRYING SOME IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN WHICH THE GUERRILLAS ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD MADE A BIG EFFORT TO SHOW THEIR PRESENCE, BUT THAT NOTHING SUBSTANTIAL RESULTED AND THEY SUFFERED MANY CASUALTIES INSTEAD, GRAMAJO SAID.

HOWEVER, IT SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT WE ARE FACING THE SAME SITUATION AS BEFORE, THEREFORE, WE HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AND WILL CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS UNTIL A CEASE-FIRE IS AGREED.     IN CARACAS WE COMMITTED OURSELVES TO NEGOTIATING AND HOLDING TALKS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A CEASE-FIRE AND THE NECESSARY AGREEMENTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COUNTRY AND THE ENTIRE NATION.     THAT IS THE IMPORTANT ISSUE RIGHT NOW.  WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING WITHOUT THAT GOAL, WITHOUT HAVING ANY COMMITMENT TO NEGOTIATE ANYTHING.  HOWEVER, THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE SITUATION SHOULD REMAIN THE SAME.  NOW THERE IS A NEW FACTOR, A COMMITMENT TO NEGOTIATE AND REACH AGREEMENTS ON ALL THOSE TOPICS.  IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE KNOW THE CONTENTS OF THE AGENDA, THAT THEY ARE FULLY AWARE OF ALL THE TOPICS TO BE DISCUSSED, AND THAT THEY KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TIMETABLE AGREEMENT FOR DISCUSSIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS.  YOU JOURNALISTS CAN HELP THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND PROBLEM.     [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] COMMANDER, WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THE FMLN TO JOIN THE PROCESS?     [HANDAL] LOOK, DEADLINES ARE NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW. WHAT IS IMPORTANT NOW IS COMPLYING WITH THE AGREEMENTS TO REACH POLITICAL AGREEMENTS.  THAT IS THE MAIN ASPECT OF THE GENEVA AGREEMENT.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME DEADLINES WILL NOT BE MET. IF DEADLINES ARE SET AND THE TIME FOR IMPLEMENTING THEM EXPIRES, THEN THIS IS TANTAMOUNT TO WASTING TIME.  THIS THEN LEADS TO STEPS BEING DEMANDED THAT IN REALITY DEPEND ON THE POLITICAL AGREEMENTS THAT ARE REACHED AND NOT THE DEADLINES FOR REACHING THEM.     THEREFORE, ACCORDING TO THE AGENDA AND THE TIMETABLE AGREED TO HERE IN CARACAS, THE ACCENT IS ON THE POLITICAL AGREEMENTS.  THOSE AGREEMENTS HAVE TO DO WITH CHANGES WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES. EVERYTHING RELATED TO THE ARMED FORCES MUST BE CHANGED.  EVERY FACTOR CONCERNING THE ARMED FORCES MUST BE REVIEWED FROM A CERTAIN POINT OR PERSPECTIVE.  CHANGES ARE NECESSARY; CHANGES MUST BE MADE AND THOSE CHANGES MUST BE SIGNIFICANT. THESE CHANGES MUST COMPLETELY TRANSFORM THE ARMED FORCES, BEGINNING WITH ITS ROLE AND INFLUENCE IN DETERMINING THE COUNTRY'S POLICIES AND GUIDELINES.     WE HAVE BEEN PRESENTING PROPOSALS IN THIS REGARD FOR SOME TIME. THE TOPIC OF DEMOCRATIZATION IS CLOSELY LINKED TO THE TOPIC OF THE ARMED FORCES, TO ITS PURGING, ITS REDUCTION, AND IN SUM, ITS END.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTRY WILL NOT ALWAYS NEED THE ARMED FORCES.  AS WITH ANY INSTITUTION OR HISTORICAL FACTOR, IT EMERGES, IT IS MAINTAINED FOR A CERTAIN TIME, AND THEN IT TENDS TO DISAPPEAR.     THE COUNTRY MUST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP. IT CANNOT CONTINUE ALONG THE SAME PATH BECAUSE THIS WOULD ONLY REPRESENT EXPENSES AND A HEAVY BURDEN FOR THE COUNTRY.     FOR SEVERAL DECADES, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE MEANT ABSENCE OF LIBERTY, REAL SECURITY, AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE CIVILIAN SOCIETY TO DECIDE THE COUNTRY'S PATH.  ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO A MERE FORMALITY, WHERE THOSE WHO WERE NOT ELECTED RUN THE COUNTRY.     THE COUNTRY IS NOW GOING THROUGH A DRAMA THAT HAS ALSO SHOCKED THE INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC, THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.  EVERYONE IS AWAITING THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS AND HOPING THAT THOSE WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CRIME WILL BE PUNISHED.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CASE OF JESUIT PRIESTS IS REALLY GRAVE; IT IS A DRAMA THAT REFLECTS THE DRAMA OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S HISTORY IN THE CURRENT CENTURY. [CONTINUED]",

THE TECHNICAL INVESTIGATION COMMISSION HAS DETERMINED THAT SOME MILITARY WERE REPORTEDLY INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUITS AND THEIR TWO MAIDS, WHICH TOOK PLACE AT DAYBREAK ON 16 NOVEMBER, AS REPORTED BY PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON 7 JANUARY.     \"THE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN REST ASSURED THE SALVADORAN JUDICIARY SYSTEM WILL NOT HESITATE TO ENFORCE THE LAW UPON THE AUTHORS OF THIS HORRIBLE CRIME,\" DR GUTIERREZ POINTED OUT.

HOWEVER, GENERAL PROSECUTOR DR MAURICIO EDUARDO COLORADO MAINTAINED THAT THE MILITARY SUSPECTS \"ARE REGROUPED AND HAVE BEEN PUT IN CUSTODY.\" HOWEVER, HE DID NOT REVEAL THE NAMES OR THE MILITARY RANKS OF THE SUSPECTS.

NEW UCA [CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY] RECTOR JESUIT FRANCISCO ESTRADA ADMITTED PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS TAKEN \"A STEP FORWARD\" BY UNMASKING THE SUSPECTS IN THIS CRIME, \"BECAUSE HIS ETHIC PRINCIPLES DO NOT TOLERATE SUCH ATROCITIES.\"     ESTRADA SAID HE UNDERSTANDS WHY CRISTIANI, DURING HIS 7 JANUARY SPEECH, DID NOT GIVE ANY NAMES, \"BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE STILL BEING CONDUCTED.\"  MOREOVER, THERE MUST NOT ONLY BE ONE SUSPECT, BUT RATHER SEVERAL.\"     BEFORE MEETING WITH THE REPORTERS, THE UCA RECTOR MET WITH OFFICIALS FROM SCOTLAND YARD.  A FEW DAYS AGO, HE ALSO MET SPANISH, CANADIAN, AND U.S.  POLICEMEN WHO, AT THE GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST, ARE ASSISTING THE SALVADORAN COMMISSION IN CHARGE OF CLARIFYING THIS CASE.",

AT 1900, A GOES [SPECIAL OPERATIONS GROUP] TEAM SURROUNDED THE RANCH.  AN AGENT MAKES SURE THE MAIN GATE IS NOT ELECTRICALLY WIRED, AND THE DECISION TO FORCIBLY ENTER THE HOUSE IS MADE. THEY ALL COVER ONE ANOTHER AS THEY TAKE THEIR POSITIONS.  THESE MEN ARE PERFECTLY TRAINED FOR THIS SORT OF WORK.  THESE IS A LIGHT INSIDE THE RANCH HOUSE, SO THEY ASSUME SOMEONE IS INSIDE.  TENSION RISES IN VIEW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ARMED CONFRONTATION.  AS HE APPROACHES THE RANCH, THE COMMANDER DECIDES TO STORM IT.  MOMENTS LATER, SEVERAL MEN OPEN THE DOOR WITHOUT OFFERING RESISTANCE AND SURRENDER TO THE AUTHORITIES.     A PATROL ENTERS QUICKLY AND CONTROLS EVERY CORNER OF THE RANCH.  OTHER UNIFORMED MEN SUPPORT THE OPERATION FROM OUTSIDE.  THEY UNSUCCESSFULLY LOOK FOR CACHES.  THESE THREE WORKERS WHO WERE DOING REPAIRS AT THE RANCH WERE DETAINED AS A PRECAUTION IN THE MAIN HALL.  MEANWHILE, THE SEARCH CONTINUES IN OTHER AREAS OF THE HOUSE.  THREE SAFES WERE HIDDEN IN DIFFERENT ROOMS OF THE RANCH HOUSE.  ONE OF THE SAFES WAS BUILT INTO ONE OF THE EIGHT MARBLE-TILED BATHROOMS.  THE HUGE KITCHEN WAS TEMPORARILY AT THE WORKERS' DISPOSAL.  NEAR THE MASTER BEDROOM WAS A LARGE SWIMMING POOL WITH A GROUND-LEVEL WINDOW FROM THE SAUNA AND JACUZZI AREA.

THEY MUST DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT TO GIVE AWAY THE ADVANTAGES OR NOT; BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE UNJUST.  A DEATH SQUAD MIGHT SAY: WE DO NOT WANT PEACE AND WE WILL SET OFF BOMBS UNTIL THE OTHERS CHANGE THEIR MINDS.     THIS IS NOT THE CASE RIGHT NOW.  WE WOULD BE SIMPLY ESTABLISHING A PRECEDENT.

THE MASSACRE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION [FENASTRAS] WAS PLANNED IN COLD BLOOD.  THE SITE AND THE MOMENT WHEN THE FENASTRAS LEADERS WERE MEETING HAD BEEN SELECTED.     2.  WE HAVE TRUSTWORTHY INFORMATION FROM OUR INTELLIGENCE ORGANS THAT THIS ACTION WAS ORDERED BY COLONEL PONCE, THAT CRISTIANI KNEW ABOUT IT AND APPROVED IT, AND THAT IT WAS CARRIED OUT BY COLONEL ELENA FUENTE AS THE HEAD OF THE MORBID DEATH SQUAD OF THE ARMY'S 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IN RESPONSE TO OUR MILITARY ATTACK ON THE ARMY STAFF.  THIS BEHAVIOR BY CRISTIANI SHOULD SURPRISE NO ONE.  TERRORISM IS AN OLD PRACTICE OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA].     ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO, ARENA ASSASSINS TRIED TO KILL THE PRESIDENT OF THE MORTGAGE BANK, MR MASON, FOR NOT FOLLOWING THEIR ORDERS.     3.  THE PEOPLE DEMAND THE RESIGNATION OF CHIEF OF STAFF COL EMILIO PONCE BECAUSE HIS RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS CRIMINAL ACTION IS REAL.     4.  THE FMLN HAS PRUDENTLY TAKEN TIME BEFORE ADOPTING A DEFINITE POSITION.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ADOPTED AN IRRESPONSIBLE ATTITUDE AND HAVE BRAZENLY ACCUSED THE FMLN OF THE CRIMES THEY COMMIT.     IN VIEW OF THIS ATTITUDE AND OF THE PEOPLE'S INDIGNATION, WE HAVE TO PREVENT OUR PRESENCE AT THE DIALOGUE FROM BEING USED TO COVER UP THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS MASSACRE AND TO ENHANCE THE MASK OF MODERATOR AND NEGOTIATOR THAT CRISTIANI HAS BEEN USING TO SECURE POLITICAL SUPPORT AND U.S. FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO EXTEND THE WAR.     IN SAN JOSE, SPEAKING ON ITS VIEW OF THE WAR, THE GOVERNMENT SAID THAT IT CONSIDERS POPULAR MOVEMENTS AS SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS OF THE FMLN, AND THEREFORE, AS ENEMIES OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THE ARMED CONFLICT.     WE DEMANDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION GIVE US A LIST OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS, BUT TO NO AVAIL.  THE TERRORIST ATTACKS AND MASSACRES ARE NOW YIELDING THE LISTS THAT WERE DENIED TO US AT THE DIALOGUE TABLE.     EVEN BEFORE THE SAN JOSE MEETING, THE GOVERNMENT HAD GREATLY INCREASED ITS REPRESSION.  SINCE THE MEETING, IT HAS INCREASED ITS DETENTIONS AND ATTACKED THE RESIDENCES OF LEADERS OF THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT AND THE UDN [NATIONALIST DEMOCRATIC UNION], UNIVERSITY, FECMASAN [MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO FEDERATION OF COMMITTEES OF MOTHERS AND RELATIVES], AND FENASTRAS.  MEANWHILE, CRISTIANI IS MAINTAINING HIS HYPOCRITICAL POSITION OF MODERATION.     THE MASSACRES, DETENTIONS, AND REPRESSION OF EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS, THE REPATRIATED, UNIVERSITIES, LABOR UNIONS, PEASANT COOPERATIVES, MOTHERS' ORGANIZATIONS, AND OTHER SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION SHOW THAT THE WAR OF THE ARMED FORCES, GOVERNMENT, AND ARENA IS AIMED AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND, THEREFORE, THESE GROUPS CANNOT AND WILL NOT REMAIN IDLE.     THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE UP ARMS AND EXERCISE THEIR LEGITIMATE DEFENSE.  THE ARMED PEOPLE'S AND REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE HEADED BY THE FMLN IS JUST, LEGITIMATE, AND NECESSARY.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] TWO-FACED CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, THE FMLN HAS DECIDED TO IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THE DIALOGUE OBSERVERS AND THE CHURCH, WHICH IS THE MEDIATOR, TO DEMAND THROUGH THEM GUARANTEES FOR OPPOSITION CIVIC AND LABOR GROUPS AND A REVIEW OF THE CURRENT CONDITIONS OF THE DIALOGUE, NEGOTIATION PROCESS, AND ITS PROSPECTS.  MEANWHILE, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO SUSPEND OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE CARACAS MEETING.

THE PRESIDENT-ELECT IMMEDIATELY CONDEMNED THE ATTACK AND ATTRIBUTED IT TO THE URBAN COMMANDOS.  AS A RESULT OF THE ATTACK, A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL WAS WOUNDED AND CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE WAS REPORTED.

[BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED MILITARY OFFICER] THE GUERRILLAS USED 60-MM MORTARS AND RPG-18 ROCKET LAUNCHERS.  THE TERRORISTS TRAVELED IN CARS.  THEY DESTROYED SEVERAL POWER POLES ON 29TH STREET AND MACHINEGUNNED SEVERAL TRANSFORMERS.  THE ATTACK CAME MAINLY FROM THE SOUTH, WHERE THE COHACHE ORGANIZATION IS LOCATED, AND FROM THE HONDUA CHURCH HERE.  THEY ALSO ATTACKED FROM THE NORTHEAST, BUT MOST OF THE ATTACKERS CAME FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, FIRING FROM THERE AT SOME [WORD INDISTINCT] WE HAVE IN THE AREA.

CHANNEL 12 HAS ALREADY REPORTED THAT A TRANSPORTATION STOPPAGE WILL BEGIN ON 31 MAY. THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE VIGILANCE MUST BE INCREASED.  WE EXPECTED THIS KIND OF ATTACK.  WE HAVE ALWAYS SAID WE ARE PREPARED TO REPEL ANY TERRORIST ATTACK, AND THIS WAS A TYPICAL TERRORIST ATTACK.  FROM A MILITARY STANDPOINT, I DO NOT THINK THE ATTACK WAS VERY EFFECTIVE.

THE FMLN PLANS THAT THE ARMED FORCES RECENTLY SEIZED INCLUDE A STRATEGY IN WHICH THE FMLN IS TO CREATE CONFUSION AMONG THE POPULATION BY NOT CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF ACTIONS AND CRIMES.  UNDER THESE GUIDELINES, THE FMLN HAS NOT CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS ACTIONS, TO INSINUATE...[CHANGES THOUGHT] TO CREATE CONFUSION OR GIVE THE IMPRESSION THIS IS A VIOLENT SITUATION THAT HAS ARISEN BETWEEN POLITICAL GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY.     FORTUNATELY THERE IS EVIDENCE.  THE ARMED FORCES HAVE THE DOCUMENTS THAT PROVE THAT THIS IS A STRATEGY CARRIED OUT BY TERRORIST GROUPS TO PERPETRATE THIS KIND OF ACTION AND PROVOKE A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE POLITICAL AND DEMOCRATIC FORCES IN THE COUNTRY.     OTHER VALUABLE INFORMATION HAS BEEN UNCOVERED, BUT I BELIEVE IT IS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE PUBLIC SECURITY AUTHORITIES TO REVEAL THIS. TERRORISTS HAVE RECENTLY ISSUED DECLARATIONS REVEALING THIS STRATEGY, THEIR MODUS OPERANDI, AND THE PLANS THEY HAVE FOR THE NEAR FUTURE. THEY HAVE PLANS TO CONTINUE DEALING BLOWS AGAINST THE NEW ADMINISTRATION THROUGH ITS OFFICIALS TO FORCE CONDITIONS FOR NEGOTIATIONS IN THE NEAR FUTURE -- AS THEY DID WITH FORMER PRESIDENT DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT.

THERE IS [WORDS INDISTINCT] FOR THE DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY, AND ANOTHER ONE THAT REFERS TO THE ANTITERRORIST LAW.  THE TRUTH IS THAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS BEEN QUITE CLEAR IN ITS POSITION, WHICH WAS STATED BY THE VICE PRESIDENCY.     THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS CLEARLY STATED IT CANNOT LET THESE PEOPLE CONTINUE OPERATING WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS OR CONTROLS, VIOLATING THE LAW, DISRUPTING SOCIAL LIFE, AND DIRECTLY AFFECTING THE [WORDS INDISTINCT].  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE MUST BE PROTECTED BY EFFECTIVE LAWS SO THE PUBLIC SECURITY FORCES CAN CONTROL THE SITUATION AND SO THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE NOT INTERPRETED AS AN ABUSE OF AUTHORITY.

THOSE LAWS DATE BACK MANY DECADES; IT WAS NEVER FORESEEN THAT EL SALVADOR COULD REACH THE CURRENT DETERIORATED SITUATION, IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE KILLED AND THE CULPRITS CALMLY WALK AWAY.  NEWSPAPERS [WORDS INDISTINCT] SAY THAT SINCE WE ARE AT WAR, IT IS EASY FOR THEM TO KILL.     [REPORTER] IT IS RUMORED THAT THE LAW [PASSAGE INDISTINCT].     [MERINO] THE PROVISIONS ALREADY EXIST; ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS HARMONIZE THEM.  WE MUST FULFILL OUR OBLIGATION.  THE CONSTITUTION [WORDS INDISTINCT] STATED THAT EVERY SECONDARY LAW SHOULD BE HARMONIZED WITH THE CONSTITUTION.  IN THIS CASE, THE PENAL CODE, THE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED TO A CERTAIN POINT, AND IT IS IMPERATIVE -- IF WE ARE GOING TO ABIDE BY THE CONSTITUTION -- TO ADAPT THEM TO OUR SITUATION.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND NO OFFICIAL OF A FRIENDLY COUNTRY CAN INTERFERE WITH THIS.     I RECENTLY TOLD SOME JOURNALISTS WHO ARE MY FRIENDS THAT VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE'S GOAL WAS TO COME AND REAFFIRM HIS GOVERNMENT'S SUPPORT OF THE NEW SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  HE DID IT ON THIS DATE BECAUSE ON 1 JUNE HE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE U.S. PRESIDENCY WHILE PRESIDENT BUSH WAS IN EUROPE.  HIS VISIT TO EL SALVADOR WAS NOT A MERE COINCIDENCE.  HE CAME TO REAFFIRM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT. [END RECORDING]",

LAST YEAR, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL STATISTICS, THERE WERE 4,600 VICTIMS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE. ABOUT HALF OF THOSE KILLED WERE PEASANTS.  AN \"INTERNAL WAR,\" UNLEASHED BY THE OLIGARCHY MANY YEARS AGO, IS BEING WAGED AGAINST THEM.  THE ACTIVISTS OF THE COALITION OF LEFT-WING PARTIES AND ORGANIZATIONS, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMUNISTS -- THE PATRIOTIC UNION -- COME NEXT, AFTER THE PEASANTS.  THE PEOPLE KILLED INCLUDE JAIME PARDO LEAL, PRESIDENT OF ITS NATIONAL COORDINATION COMMITTEE, AROUND 30 DEPUTIES, AND MANY MUNICIPAL ADVISORS AND MAYORS.     THE ORGANIZERS OF THE \"DIRTY WAR\" AND THE LEADERS OF THE \"DEATH SQUADS,\" AND OTHER ULTRA-RIGHT-WING FORMATIONS AND THEIR HIRED KILLERS, FEEL THAT THEY CAN GO UNPUNISHED.  THE RESPONSE TO THE TERROR OF THE RIGHT HAS THE ARMED STRUGGLE WHICH HAS CONTINUED FOR MANY YEARS AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM.     IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, VICTIMS OF POLITICAL TERROR ALSO INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE RULING CIRCLES AND THEIR LAW-ENFORCEMENT ORGANS, WAGING AN UNEQUAL STRUGGLE AGAINST THE POWERFUL NARCOTICS MAFIA.  AS A \"SHADOW ECONOMY,\" IT IS TRYING TO BECOME PART OF THE STATE STRUCTURE.  IN THE PAST YEAR THE NARCOTICS BUSINESS HAS \"ENRICHED\" THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY WITH $2 BILLION AND EVEN PROPOSED THAT IT WOULD PAY OFF THE GIGANTIC FOREIGN DEBT.

THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE, A MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT, A DIRECTOR OF THE BIGGEST NEWSPAPER ESPECTADOR, AND, A FEW DAYS AGO, ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR, GOVERNOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTIOQUIA WERE KILLED.  MANY PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES ARE LEAVING THE COUNTRY THROUGH FEAR FOR THEIR OWN LIVES AND THOSE OF THEIR RELATIVES.     THE VIOLENCE IS ESCALATING AND THE IMPRESSION IS BEING FORMED THAT CERTAIN FORCES ARE TRYING TO TAKE THE ATTENTION OF THE 30 MILLION STRONG POPULATION OF COLOMBIA AWAY FROM THE URGENT RESOLUTION OF PRESSING SOCIAL PROBLEMS BY DESTABILIZING INTERNAL LIFE.

DRASTIC ACTIONS ARE NEEDED PARTICULARLY ON BEHALF OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS.     WE CONSIDER THAT IN COLOMBIA ITSELF, DIALOGUE BETWEEN OPPOSING SIDES THAT ARE TAKING THE STAND OF PATRIOTISM AND POLITICAL REALISM IS NECESSARY.

CRISTIANI BEGINS BY SAYING THAT THIS IS HIS FIRST REPORT TO THE NATION AFTER 50 DAYS AS PRESIDENT.  HE NOTES THAT SINCE HE ASSUMED POWER ON 1 JUNE, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT HAS INCREASED ITS LEVEL OF VIOLENCE AND ITS NUMBER OF \"INDISCRIMINATE KILLINGS.\"  HE SAYS THAT THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS SINCE HE EXPRESSED ON 1 JUNE HIS DESIRE FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY.     CRISTIANI SAYS THAT SINCE 1 JUNE HE HAS REPEATEDLY CALLED FOR A PEACE DIALOGUE, ADDING:  \"IN ORDER TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE OF THIS NATURE, IT MUST BE HELD IN TWO PHASES:  NATURALLY, DURING THE FIRST PHASE BOTH SIDES MUST SIT DOWN TO DISCUSS THE MECHANISMS TO DEVELOP THAT DIALOGUE PROCESS, A TIMETABLE FOR THE TALKS, AND THE PLACE WHERE THE TALKS WILL BE HELD.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE FIRST PHASE WILL BE TO DETERMINE HOW THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WILL TAKE PLACE.  THE SECOND PHASE -- ONCE AN AGREEMENT IS REACHED ON HOW THE DIALOGUE WILL BE HELD -- IS WHAT WILL BE DISCUSSED.  IN THAT REGARD, OUR GOVERNMENT HAS NOT SET ANY CONDITIONS.  WE ARE WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY TOPIC, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE MUST FIND SOLUTIONS TO MANY THINGS, AND WE ARE WILLING TO DO SO.  THE ONLY CONDITION WE HAVE DEMANDED FOR THIS DIALOGUE PROCESS IS THAT, ONCE IT BEGINS, IT SHOULD NOT BE INTERRUPTED FOR ANY REASON.  WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WANT PEACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND WE CANNOT HOLD TALKS FOR YEARS.  ONCE WE SIT DOWN TO TALK, THAT DIALOGUE SHOULD CONTINUE UNTIL AN OVERALL SOLUTION IS FOUND TO THE CONFLICT.  THAT IS OUR GOVERNMENT'S POSITION, AND WE MAINTAIN THAT POSITION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS THE MOST LOGICAL ONE.\"     TURNING TO ECONOMIC MATTERS, CRISTIANI SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO SOLVE THREE PROBLEMS:  THE FISCAL DEFICIT, INFLATION, AND UNEMPLOYMENT.  HE SAYS THAT AS A FIRST STEP TO BEGIN THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS TO REFORM THE GOVERNMENT'S PRICING POLICY, ADDING:  \"WE MUST PROTECT LOW-INCOME GROUPS, AND FOR THIS REASON WE HAVE ASKED THE ECONOMY MINISTER TO BEGIN A PROCESS AIMED AT ELIMINATING PRICE CONTROLS.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ELIMINATE PRICE CONTROLS ON 230 PRODUCTS WITHOUT HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE MAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC AND THAT WE CAN KEEP STAPLE PRODUCTS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE ECONOMY MINISTRY.\"  HE SAYS THAT PRICE CONTROLS ON STAPLES LIKE BASIC GRAINS, POWDERED MILK, FLOUR, COFFEE, SUGAR, VEGETABLE OIL AND LARD, CEMENT FOR HOUSING, AND OIL BY-PRODUCTS WILL NOT BE ELIMINATED.     REGARDING THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"WE AGREED WITH THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TO DEREGULATE THE DIFFERENTIAL SERVICE. TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE SERVING LOW-INCOME SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION WHILE CHARGING CURRENT FARES, WE WILL ALSO ALLOW THEM TO OFFER THE HIGHER-PRICED SERVICE.  IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHAT KIND OF SERVICE THEY WANT TO USE: WHETHER THEY CONTINUE TO USE THE LOW-PRICED SERVICE OR A BETTER, MORE COMFORTABLE, AND FASTER SERVICE.\"     ON ELECTRICITY RATES, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"WE FEEL THAT ADJUSTMENTS TO ELECTRICITY RATES SHOULD BE APPLIED AS A RESULT OF POWER THAT IS WASTED, THAT IS, BECAUSE IT IS POWER THAT IS BEING CONSUMED BEYOND WHAT IS NEEDED TO LIVE NORMALLY.  THE INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY RATES WILL BE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY IN EACH HOME.  WE BELIEVE THAT WITH THIS INITIAL MEASURE, THE CEL [LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION] SOLVE PROBLEMS.\"     TURNING TO OTHER ECONOMIC MEASURES, CRISTIANI SAYS:  \"WE HAVE TO TAKE SHORT-TERM MEASURES TOO.  IN THIS RESPECT, THE MOST LOGICAL STEP IS TO TAKE MEASURES THAT WILL AFFECT CONSUMPTION AND NOT REVENUES. THUS, WE HAVE ASKED THE FINANCE MINISTER TO TAKE MEASURES RELATED TO TAXES.  HE IS TO CONSOLIDATE TAX PAYMENTS AND ONLY EXEMPT THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BASIC BREAD BASKET ITEMS FROM THE PRESENT 5-PERCENT TAX.  WE HAVE TO START ELIMINATING TAX EXEMPTIONS.  ONLY EXPORTS SHOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF MONETARY INCENTIVE BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING ITS EXPORTS.  THE REST OF THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC SECTORS SHOULD BE TAXED AT THE SAME RATE.\"     CRISTIANI ADDS:  \"WE ARE GOING TO MODIFY THE SYSTEM OF PAYING INCOME TAX.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS BASED ON UNJUST REGULATIONS, ON REVENUES EARNED THE PREVIOUS YEAR THAT DO NOT REFLECT A FIRM'S PRESENT SITUATION.  THUS, WE ARE GOING TO REQUEST THAT INCOME-TAX PAYMENTS BE BASED ON A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRM'S PRESENT SALES; THESE ARE A TRUER AND MORE ACCURATE REFLECTION OF A FIRM'S INCOME.\"     CRISTIANI SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY'S MONETARY POLICY MUST BE AIMED AT INCREASING SAVINGS TO PROMOTE DOMESTIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  HE SAYS THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE INTEREST RECEIVED ON SAVINGS ACCOUNTS IN THE COUNTRY'S BANKS MORE ATTRACTIVE SO THAT CAPITAL DOES NOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY. REGARDING THE COUNTRY'S CURRENCY, CRISTIANI SAYS:  \"WE FEEL THAT CURRENCY VALUE SHOULD BE BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF AND DEMAND FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE.  WE DO NOT THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ARBITRARILY DEVALUE AND FIX AN EXCHANGE RATE ON THE SALVADORAN COLON. EVERYTHING MUST BE BASED ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE OUR COUNTRY MAY HAVE TO PAY OUT FOR IMPORTS, BECAUSE IF WE WERE TO FIX THE RATE AT 10 [COLONES] TO 1 [DOLLAR], THE CENTRAL BANKS STILL WOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH FOREIGN EXCHANGE TO COVER ALL THE IMPORTERS' DEMANDS.\"     FURTHER DETAILS AS AVAILABLE.",

    "doctext": "SANTIAGO, 16 JUL 89 -- [STATEMENT] [CHILEAN SOCIALIST PARTY, PS] [TEXT]     1. DURING THE YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP, CHILEAN FOREIGN RELATIONS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO PROCESSES. ON THE ONE HAND, AS THE DICTATORSHIP BECAME MORE AND MORE ISOLATED, IT WAS INCREASINGLY CONDEMNED IN INTERNATIONAL FORA AND REPUDIATED BY INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION. ON THE OTHER HAND, AS MORE AND MORE COUNTRIES AND ORGANIZATIONS EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT FOR A FREE CHILE AND GENEROUSLY GRANTED THEIR SOLIDARITY TO OUR CAUSE, OUR ORGANIZATIONS AND DEMOCRATIC PARTIES BECAME INCREASINGLY OPEN TO THE WORLD. THUS, THEY EXPANDED THEIR HORIZONS AND CONTRIBUTED THEIR EXPERIENCES.     2. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE PARTY HAS SUBSTANTIALLY STRENGTHENED ITS INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND ENHANCED ITS VISION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION. IT HAS STRENGTHENED ITS TIES WITH THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLES' REVOLUTIONARY AND DEMOCRATIC CAUSE, AND IT HAS FULLY IMMERSED ITSELF IN THE GREAT DEBATES OF WORLD SOCIALISM. TO THESE DEBATES WE BROUGHT OUR VIEWS ON A PROFOUNDLY RENEWED LEFTIST SOCIALISM COMMITTED TO DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT, AND SOCIAL CHANGE.     3. OUR RELATIONS WITH THE PARTIES THAT MAKE UP THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST [SI] AND WITH THE SI ORGANIZATION ITSELF HAVE BEEN ENRICHED WITHIN THIS CONTEXT. THIS STRENGTHENING OF TIES HAS BEEN THE RESULT OF TWO THINGS. FIRST, IT IS BASED ON THE POSITION THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS PRINCIPLES THE SI HAS UPHELD REGARDING THE CHILEAN SITUATION. IN OCTOBER 1973, A FEW DAYS AFTER THE COUP, SI CHAIRMAN WILLY BRANDT CONDEMNED THE END OF THE CHILEAN DEMOCRACY AND PRESIDENT ALLENDE'S ASSASSINATION AT THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY. AT THE TIME HE ALSO SAID THIS WAS A GREAT STEP BACKWARD FOR THOSE WHO ASPIRED TO ACHIEVE SOCIALISM THROUGH DEMOCRATIC MEANS. SINCE THEN, THE SI HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY MOBILIZED IN FAVOR OF CHILE BY MAKING THE CHILEAN CAUSE AND SALVADOR ALLENDE THE SYMBOLS OF ALL INTERNATIONAL STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY AND CHANGE. IT IS WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK OF INTEREST AND COOPERATION THAT THE VOICE OF CHILEAN SOCIALISM HAS BEEN HEARD AND OUR IDEAS AND PROPOSALS PRAISED.     4. THE SECOND REASON STEMS FROM THE PROCESS OF EXPANSION AND TRANSFORMATION EXPERIENCED BY THE SI IN THE PAST 2 DECADES. THE OVERALL PROCESS OF CHANGE THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE WORLD DURING THIS PERIOD -- THE TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION, THE GROWING INTERDEPENDENCE AMONG NATIONS, EXPANSION OF COMMUNICATIONS, GLOBAL NUCLEAR AND MILITARY PROLIFERATION, THE EMERGENCE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS INTERNATIONAL COUNTERPARTS, THE WORSENING OF EXTREME POVERTY AND INTERNATIONAL INEQUALITIES, THE PROGRESS OF LIBERATION STRUGGLES IN THE THIRD WORLD, INTERNATIONAL AWARENESS OF THE VALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS -- HAS ALSO EFFECTED MAJOR CHANGES IN THE IDEAS AND POSITIONS OF SOCIALIST PARTIES AROUND THE WORLD. IN THIS FRAMEWORK, THE SI HAS EXPANDED ITS OUTLOOK, HAS INCREASINGLY RENEWED ITS IDEAS AND, ABOVE ALL, HAS ACCEPTED PLURALISM WITHIN ITS FOLD AS WELL AS A BROAD INTERNAL DEBATE ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO PROMOTE THE CAUSE OF AN AUTONOMOUS, DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS DEBATE ACQUIRED A DEMOCRATIC, ANTIFASCIST CONTENT AS A RESULT OF THE MAJOR ROLE PLAYED BY SOCIALIST FORCES THAT HAVE ENGAGED IN A LONG ANTIFASCIST STRUGGLE. [CONTINUED]",

[AZCONA] I BELIEVE THAT AT THIS SUMMIT THE CENTRAL [WORDS INDISTINCT].     [REPORTER] HOW, MR PRESIDENT?     [AZCONA] WELL, I DO NOT KNOW.  IT IS NOT EASY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. NONE OF THE PROBLEMS WILL BE EASY TO SOLVE.     [REPORTER] IS THERE A POSSIBILITY FOR DIALOGUE?     [AZCONA] YES, BUT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WOULD ALSO HAVE TO HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE.     [REPORTER] I AM THE VOZ DE NICARAGUA REPORTER.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THE AGREEMENT REACHED BY THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES?     [AZCONA] WELL, I READ THE AGREEMENT LAST NIGHT AND BELIEVE IT TO BE A STEP FORWARD.  INCIDENTALLY, I READ IT TWICE LAST NIGHT AND IT IS A VERY LONG DOCUMENT.  I AM TALKING ABOUT THE AGREEMENT WITH THE PARTIES THAT ARE TRULY OPPOSITION PARTIES AND NOT THE ONE MADE WITH THE OTHER PARTIES BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT REALLY OPPOSITION PARTIES.     [REPORTER] WHAT I WANTED WAS YOUR OPINION ON THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS FROM HONDURAS.     [AZCONA] OH, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SMALL DOCUMENT THAT MAKES DEMANDS, DEMANDS, AND MORE DEMANDS.  THIS DOCUMENT HAS NO VALUE.     [REPORTER] I MEAN THE DOCUMENT SIGNED WITH THE 21 POLITICAL PARTIES...     [AZCONA, INTERRUPTING] THAT AGREEMENT IS VALUABLE BUT IT DOES NOT MENTION THE CONTRA DEMOBILIZATION.  THE DOCUMENT STATES THAT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND THE OPPOSITION PARTIES AGREE THAT THE ESQUIPULAS II AND COSTA DEL SOL AGREEMENTS SHOULD BE ABIDED BY.  THIS IS THE DOCUMENT I READ TWICE, AND I BELIEVE IT IS QUITE SERIOUS AND A STEP FORWARD.     [REPORTER] WHAT WILL YOU DO TO GET THE MERCENARIES TO LEAVE YOUR COUNTRY?     [AZCONA] FIRST, I DO NOT USE DEROGATORY TERMS.  THEY ARE NICARAGUANS WHO FOR DIFFERENT REASONS DISAGREE WITH THE SYSTEM IN NICARAGUA.  THESE NICARAGUANS OPPOSE THE SYSTEM, AND FOR THIS AND OTHER REASONS THEY HAVE TAKEN UP ARMS AGAINST THE SYSTEM AND HAVE TAKEN REFUGE IN HONDURAS.  I DO NOT USE THE TERM MERCENARY.  I UNDERSTAND THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT USES IT AND IT IS ALL RIGHT FOR THEM TO DO SO, BUT I WILL NOT ANSWER A QUESTION THAT USES A TERM THAT I BELIEVE IS TOO DEROGATORY.     [REPORTER] THE DEMOBILIZATION PLAN HAS A VERY FIRM DEADLINE AND IS TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN 90 DAYS.  DO YOU THINK...     [AZCONA, INTERRUPTING] NO, NO.  THE 90-DAY DEADLINE IS INCLUDED IN AN AGREEMENT SIGNED BY NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ORTEGA WITH THREE SMALL NICARAGUAN LEFTIST PARTIES.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS DOCUMENT IS VERY IMPORTANT.  I DO BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THE AGREEMENT SIGNED BY THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT AND THE OPPOSITION PARTIES IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON THE ESQUIPULAS II AND COSTA DEL SOL AGREEMENTS.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] TERRORISTS IN EL SALVADOR AND CONTRAS ARE PRESENTLY NOT ACTIVE, SO BOTH SITUATIONS -- CONTRAS AND GUERRILLAS -- ARE DIFFERENT.

[AZCONA] [WORDS INDISTINCT] PRESIDENT CRISTIANI COMES TO THE SUMMIT AS EL SALVADOR'S LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT.  HE HAS THE RIGHT TO PRESENT HIS POINTS OF VIEW.  HE HAS THE RIGHT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS IN OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL AS TO ONES IN HIS OWN COUNTRY.     [REPORTER] IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT A DEMOBILIZATION PLAN FOR THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS WILL BE STUDIED AT THIS SUMMIT IF PRESIDENT CRISTINAI PRESENTS ONE?     [AZCONA] OF COURSE.

ACCORDING TO A REPORT WHICH CITES RELIABLE SOURCES, IT SEEMS THAT THE HAND OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS IS BEHIND THE ASSASSINATIONS OF JUDGE CARLOS VALENCIA, OF THE BOGOTA [WORDS INDISTINCT], WHICH OCCURRED YESTERDAY [18 AUGUST].  THE COLOMBIAN DRUG MAFIA HAS CREATED A GREAT MONEY AND CRIME EMPIRE IN COLOMBIA WITH POWERFUL RAMIFICATIONS OUTSIDE ITS BORDERS, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES -- THE MAIN CONSUMER OF COCAINE AND OTHER DRUGS IN THE WORLD.     YESTERDAY [18 AUGUST], VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ SPOKE ON THE PHONE WITH HIS COLOMBIAN COUNTERPART, VIRGILIO BARCO, AND IT IS SAID THAT THE MAIN SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION WAS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUTH DELINQUENCY AND DRUG TRAFFICKING.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE WORDS OF VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ.  WE MUST REFLECT, SAID CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ, ON THE NEED FOR US, ALL VENEZUELANS, TO FACE DRUG TRAFFICKING IN VENEZUELA.  WE MUST ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DRUG TRAFFICKING IS THE ABOMINABLE CRIME OF OUR TIMES, AND THAT THERE CANNOT BE ANY HESITATION OR COMPASSION TOWARD DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  THOSE ARE THE WORDS OF VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ.     IN REALITY, THE DRUG TRAFFICKING DRAMA IS SERIOUSLY AFFECTING SEVERAL LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES.  WE HAVE THE DRAMATIC CASE OF COLOMBIA, BUT THE SITUATION ALSO EXISTS IN VENEZUELA, BOLIVIA, PERU, WELL, IN SEVERAL LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES.  NOW, THE SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM...[REPHRASES] AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT BY LATIN AMERICANS THEMSELVES AND THEIR MOST PROMINENT FIGURES, THE FINAL SOLUTION TO THE DRAMATIC DRUG TRAFFICKING PROBLEM MUST BE BASED ON PUTTING AN END TO THE CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS.  THAT IS THE MAIN STUMBLING BLOCK IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THE UNITED STATES IS THE MAIN CONSUMPTION CENTER OF DRUGS IN THE WORLD, AND U.S. POLICY ON DRUG TRAFFICKING IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE NEED TO PUT AN END AND ACTIVELY REPRESS THE CONSUMPTION OF DRUGS.  U.S.  POLICY, AND ALL THIS IS VERY WELL KNOWN IN LATIN AMERICA, IS BASED ON DESTROYING THE PLANTATIONS OF A NATIVE PLANT IN THE CONTINENT, WHICH IS COCA.  PRESIDENTS, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FIGURES OF THE CONTINENT HAVE SAID THAT THE SOLUTION IS NOT BASED ON THE DESTRUCTION OF A NATIVE PLANT BUT IN ACTIVE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG CONSUMPTION.     I THINK THAT THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA AND THE DRAMATIC SITUATION THAT COLOMBIA IS FACING THESE DAYS CONFIRM THAT THE POLICY FOR FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKING MUST BE TENACIOUS, STRONG, WITHOUT HESITATION AND COMPASSION.  IT MUST ALSO BE BASED ON ENDING DRUG CONSUMPTION BY THE UNITED STATES -- THE MAIN DRUG CONSUMER OF THE WORLD -- WHICH LIVES PRECISELY FROM DRUG CONSUMPTION AND ITS BUSINESS.",

ISRAELI CHARGE D'AFFAIRS MICHEL RONEN ADMITTED THERE ARE SEVERAL ISRAELIS ENGAGED IN THAT ILLEGAL ACTIVITY, BUT WARNED THAT THEY DO SO \"ON THEIR OWN AND DO NOT ACT ON BEHALF OF MY GOVERNMENT.\"     MOREOVER, THIS OFFICIAL DENIED THAT JUBIZ HAZVUMB, CAPTURED 22 AUGUST BY COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES FOR HIS ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE MURDER OF SENATOR AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE LUIS CARLOS GALAN, WAS AN ISRAELI CITIZEN.     ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS REVEALED BY THE PRESS, THE SUSPECT IS AN ISRAELI MERCENARY PAID BY THE MEDELLIN CARTEL -- THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL DRUG-TRAFFICKING MAFIA -- THAT APPEARS TO BE DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE MURDERS OF GALAN, A HIGH-RANKING POLICE OFFICER, AND A JUDGE LAST WEEK.     REPORTS DISCLOSING THE PRESENCE OF THESE TERRORISTS IN COLOMBIA APPEARED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WHEN TELEVISION CLIPS SHOWED A MAN GIVING INSTRUCTIONS IN HEBREW TO A RIGHT-WING PARAMILITARY SQUAD.     SIMILAR CLIPS WERE BROADCAST BY THE U.S. TELEVISION NETWORK NBC, PROMPTING A COMMUNIQUE FROM JERUSALEM WHICH REQUESTED COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES AND INTERPOL TO PROVIDE ALL INFORMATION ON THE MATTER.     ACORDING TO THE ISRAELI OFFICIAL, THE TERRORISTS' ACTIONS IN COLOMBIA RUN \"COUNTER TO ISRAEL'S POLICIES.\"     INVESTIGATIONS BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS) -- THE STATE'S INTELLIGENCE CORPS -- DISCLOSED THE LINKS BETWEEN THE DRUG-TRAFFICKING MAFIAS AND ULTRARIGHT-WING PARAMILITARY GROUPS.     ACCORDING TO DAS DIRECTOR GENERAL MIGUEL MAZA MARQUEZ, THE DRUG-TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS, ESPECIALLY THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, SET UP SEVERAL \"SCHOOLS FOR GUNMEN\" IN A VAST REGION IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY WITH ISRAELI, BRITISH, U.S. AND WEST GERMAN TERRORIST INSTRUCTORS.  MOREOVER, NBC WARNED OF THE PRESENCE OF SOUTH AFRICANS.     THE PARAMILITARY SQUADS ARE ACCUSED OF HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUAL MURDERS AND MASSACRES AGAINST POLITICAL AND LABOR LEADERS, AS WELL AS PEASANTS AND PATRIOTIC UNION LEFTIST MILITANTS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.     THE AUTHORITIES ARE ACCUSING THESE SQUADS' KILLERS OF BEING BEHIND THE CRIME WAVE THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING SINCE LAST WEEK, WITH THE MURDERS OF PEOPLE KNOWN FOR THEIR ACTIVITIES AGAINST COCAINE TRAFFICKING.",

THESE TWO COUNTRIES ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR COCAINE CROPS AND THE DRUG CARTEL'S ORGANIZED ACTIVITIES.  IN ADDITION, EXTREMIST RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING ORGANIZATIONS THERE ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO ACHIEVE POLITICAL GOALS THROUGH TERRORIST ACTIVITY.     HADASHOT HAS LEARNED FROM A SOURCE WHO WAS IN PERU FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS THAT ELEMENTS LINKED TO THE DRUG GROWERS SPENT APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION ON MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM ISRAELI ARMS DEALERS IN 1987.  THE EQUIPMENT INCLUDED GALIL RIFLES, FLAK JACKETS, AMMUNITION BELTS AND AMMUNITION, VARIOUS TYPES OF GRENADES, AND COMMUNICATIONS AND NIGHT VISION EQUIPMENT.  IN 1988 AND 1989, IN ADDITIONAL DEALS WORTH SOME $6 MILLION, MORTARS, SHELLS, SNIPER RIFLES, AND AMMUNITION FOR LIGHT WEAPONS WERE PURCHASED.     THE ARMS WERE SENT TO PERU VIA MEXICO AND GUATEMALA.  AT LEAST 3 IDF [ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES] RESERVE OFFICERS WERE IN PERU FOR OVER 2 MONTHS IN EARLY 1988 TO ORGANIZE FIGHTING UNITS.  THE PERUVIAN FIGHTERS WERE PRESENTED TO THE OFFICERS AS BELONGING TO RIGHT-WING POLITICAL BODIES IN THE COUNTRY, AND THE TEAM OF INSTRUCTORS INCLUDED MERCENARIES FROM THE NETHERLANDS AND ENGLAND.     THE TEAM OF INSTRUCTORS WAS MADE UP OF SOME 10 PEOPLE, SOME OF WHOM WERE RECRUITED THROUGH AN ISRAELI-NETHERLANDER ARMS DEALER WHO LIVES IN AMSTERDAM.  THE NETHERLANDS MEDIA IS CONDUCTING A WIDE-RANGING INVESTIGATION INTO THE SUBJECT DESPITE THE SURPRISING LACK OF INTEREST BY THE NETHERLANDS AUTHORITIES IN THE AFFAIR.     AT THE SAME TIME, ISRAELIS IN NEIGHBORING BOLIVIA ACTED AS INSTRUCTORS IN A COURSE ON SAFEGUARDING BUSINESSMEN, GUERRILLA WARFARE, AND REGIONAL DEFENSE.  THESE ISRAELIS REACHED BOLIVIA IN THE WAKE OF AN ARMS CONSIGNMENT WORTH SOME $12 MILLION, WHICH ARRIVED IN PERU [COUNTRY AS PUBLISHED] VIA A THIRD PARTY, WHICH PURCHASED IT IN AN AFRICAN COUNTRY, WHICH IN TURN HAD RECEIVED IT FROM ISRAEL.     FOLLOWING THE REPORTS ON DEALS BY ISRAELIS ABROAD, THE INCOME TAX INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION HAS BEGUN AN INQUIRY INTO TAX PAYMENTS ON ISRAELI ARMS DEALS AND TRAINING ABROAD.     IN THE PAST 5 YEARS, THE SCOPE OF COMMISSIONS PAID TO ARMS DEALERS IS ESTIMATED AT $1 BILLION.  AT LEAST HALF OF IT WENT TO BIG DEALERS, SUCH AS SHA'UL EISENBERG, MARCUS KATZ, PESAH BEN-OR, ISRACES, AND OTHERS.  THEY ARE NOT UNDER SUSPICION OF TRYING TO CHEAT OR HIDE INFORMATION FROM THE TAX AUTHORITIES.",

OUR REPORTER HERNANDO CORRALES HAS THE DETAILS:     [BEGIN RECORDING] [CORRALES] IF THE AUTHORITIES IN CHARGE OF AN OPERATION NEAR PUERTO BOYACA ON 18 JULY LAST YEAR HAD NOT SABOTAGED IT, THE FOREIGN INSTRUCTORS AT THE SERVICE OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL WOULD NOW BE JAIL.  ON THAT DATE, MARTA LUCIA GONZALEZ, SECOND JUDGE OF PUBLIC ORDER, WROTE A FILE NOTE SAYING THAT THE JUDICIAL INSPECTION WAS UNJUSTLY TORPEDOED WITH THE ARGUMENT THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN FOUND AND THAT THIS ARGUMENT WAS SENSELESS AND ILLOGICAL SINCE ABSOLUTELY NO ONE OTHER THAN THE UNDERSIGNED JUDGE COULD DECIDE IF HE OR SHE HAD ANYTHING TO INSPECT, OR IF HE OR SHE SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT CONDUCT THE JUDICIAL PROCEEDING.     THE DOCUMENT, WHICH IS CONTAINED IN THE DOSSIER ON THE MASSACRE IN LA HONDURA AND LA NEGRA, URABA REGION, SAYS THAT SHE WAS LEFT 2 DAYS INSIDE A PLANE AT THE AIRPORT OF THE TEXAS PETROLEUM COMPANY IN PUERTO BOYACA AND THAT THE POLICE AUTHORITIES ACCOMPANYING HER FAILED TO EXPLAIN TO HER WHY THEY HAD NOT TAKEN ANY ACTION.     [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] IN FACT, SHE AND SEVERAL DAS INSPECTORS ENCOUNTERED SOME OBSTACLES.  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WAS INFORMED OF THESE OBSTACLES IN ORDER FOR IT TO MAKE AN INVESTIGATION. I THINK THAT WHEN SHE AND THE DAS PERSONNEL WERE PREPARING TO GO TO PUERTO BOYACA IT WAS ALREADY KNOWN THAT THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE PRESENT THERE FOR THESE PROCEEDINGS AND THIS WAS QUITE WORRISOME.     [CORRALES] AS IS KNOWN, JUDGE GONZALEZ HAD TO LEAVE COLOMBIA BECAUSE HER LIFE WAS THREATENED, AND HER FATHER, FORMER BOYACA GOVERNOR ALVARO GONZALEZ SANTANA, WAS SUBSEQUENTLY MURDERED.     MOREOVER, GEN MAZA MARQUEZ SAID FURTHER THAT THE FACT THAT A PAYMENT IS BEING OFFERED FOR THE CAPTURE OF PABLO ESCOBAR AND GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA DOES NOT MEAN THAT OTHER PERSONS ACCUSED OF BEING CAPOS OF THE MAFIA ARE NOT BEING SOUGHT TOO.     [MAZA] WE ARE TAKING ACTION THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE COUNTRY. WE ARE NOT SHOWING ANY SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS BECAUSE WE INTEND TO ACT INDISCRIMINATELY.  WHAT WE WANT IS TO FIGHT A SCOURGE THAT HAS GREATLY HARMED ALL COLOMBIANS.     [CORRALES] THE DAS DIRECTOR SAID THAT IF ANYONE BEING HELD IN CONNECTION WITH THE INVESTIGATION OF THE KILLING OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN IS RELEASED, THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOT PROCEEDING WELL.

THE FIRST BOMB EXPLODED BY THE DOOR OF A BANCO DE OCCIDENTE BRANCH AT 2115 LOCAL TIME (0215 GMT), AND THE SHOCK WAVE DAMAGED OTHER NEARBY BANKS.     FOLLOWING THE EXPLOSION, A 9-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO LIVES NEAR THE BANCO DE OCCIDENTE WAS WOUNDED BY PIECES OF GLASS, SAID HIS RELATIVES, WHO TOOK HIM TO THE \"MARLY\" CLINIC NEAR THE AREA.     AT THE SAME TIME, ANOTHER BOMB EXPLODED AT A BANCO POPULAR BRANCH, TWO BLOCKS AWAY FROM WHERE THE FIRST EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE, POLICE SAID.     OTHER BANKS AND SHOPS WERE DAMAGED BY THE SECOND EXPLOSION, AND THE SECURITY GUARD AT THE BANCO POPULAR WAS ALSO INJURED BY PIECES OF FLYING GLASS, THE AUTHORITIES SAID.     ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY REPORTS, TWO MEN PLACED THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES AND LEFT THE SCENE ON FOOT.     BOTH OF THESE ATTACKS TONIGHT, ATTRIBUTED TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKING CARTELS, TOOK PLACE AFTER 10 BOMBS EXPLODED EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE TEUSAQUILLO AREA IN DOWNTOWN BOGOTA.  THE BOMBS WERE PLACED IN NINE POLITICAL OFFICES OF THE LIBERAL AND SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PARTIES AND IN ANOTHER BANK OFFICE.",

GEN VARGAS HAS SAID THAT THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED IN THE ATTACK THAT TOOK PLACE AT SUBA MUNICIPALITY LAST NIGHT HAVE NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED.     [VARGAS] TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND FIVE OTHERS WERE WOUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE ATTACK.  THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED ARE YET TO BE IDENTIFIED.  THOSE WOUNDED INCLUDE THREE EMPLOYEES OF THE GAS STATION WHERE THE CAR BOMB WENT OFF AND TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE WALKING BY THE GAS STATION AT THE MOMENT OF THE EXPLOSION.  PRELIMINARY REPORTS HAVE ESTIMATED THAT THE EXPLOSION CAUSED 70 MILLION PESOS IN LOSSES.     [CARRILLO] GENERAL, APPROXIMATELY HOW MANY KILOGRAMS OF EXPLOSIVES WERE IN THE CAR BOMB?     [VARGAS] APPARENTLY IT CONTAINED 60 KG OF DYNAMITE.  THE DYNAMITE WAS PLACED INSIDE AN OLD STATION WAGON.  SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE INSIDE THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION -- THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED.  APPARENTLY THE CAR BOMB WENT OFF BY ACCIDENT.  IT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE GONE OFF AT THAT GAS STATION.     [CARRILLO] HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED BEEN IDENTIFIED?     [VARGAS] NO, NOT YET.  WE ARE TRYING TO IDENTIFY THEM NOW.     [CARRILLO] ARE THERE SPECIAL SECURITY MEASURES TO COUNTER THIS WAVE OF TERRORISM?     [VARGAS] YES, OF COURSE.  WE ARE CARRYING OUT A SERIES OF JOINT ACTIONS WITH THE BOGOTA POLICE DEPARTMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY PERSONNEL TO NEUTRALIZE TERRORIST ACTIONS.  WE ARE CARRYING OUT THOSE ACTIONS IN AREAS WE CONSIDER CRITICAL OR VULNERABLE AND IN OTHER AREAS WHERE WE ARE COUNTERACTING AND NEUTRALIZING TERRORIST ACTIONS, AS I TOLD YOU.     [CARRILLO] ARE THERE SECRET AGENTS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CITY?     [VARGAS] YES, WE HAVE UNIFORMED AND CIVILIAN PERSONNEL GUARDING THE CITY RIGHT NOW.  WE ALSO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE BOGOTA POLICE DEPARTMENT, OF DIJIN [DIRECTORATE OF JUDICIAL POLICE AND INVESTIGATIONS], AND OF CIJIN [EXPANSION UNKNOWN]. THEY ARE COOPERATING WITH US.  THEY ARE GUARDING AREAS WE CONSIDER CRITICAL OR PLACES THAT COULD BE TARGETS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS.     [CARRILLO] WHAT OTHER MEASURES HAVE YOU ADOPTED ALONG WITH THE 13TH INFANTRY BRIGADE AND THE BOGOTA MAYOR?     [VARGAS] WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF MEASURES, SUCH AS INCREASING PERSONNEL ON THE STREETS AND HUMAN AND MATERIAL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED CHEKCKPOINTS IN AREAS WE CONSIDER CRITICAL AND ARE CARRYING OUT A NUMBER OF OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT WILL HELP US LOCATE THESE CRIMINALS.",

COL PONCE SAID THAT WITH THIS ATTITUDE THE REBELS ARE NOT SHOWING A REAL DESIRE FOR PEACE, AND HE DESCRIBED IT AS A PROPAGANDISTIC ACTION.     TODAY, DURING HIS TOUR OF VARIOUS AREAS OF CONFLICT, COL PONCE SAID THAT RECENT FMLN ATTACKS ON VARIOUS MILITARY POSITIONS AS PART OF ITS LATEST CAMPAIGN FOLLOWING THE UNILATERAL TRUCE WAS A SERIOUS MISTAKE ON THE PART OF THE REBEL COMMANDERS, AS THEY HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT IN THE MIDST OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE REBELS AND THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS CONTINUOUS.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] THAT SHOWS THERE ARE, ON THE ONE HAND, THE PROPOSALS AND WHAT THE TERRORIST LEADERS CALL THEIR DESIRE FOR PEACE, AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE REAL ACTIONS.  I THINK THAT THE CAMPAIGN THE FMLN HAS MOUNTED NATIONWIDE WAS A BAD STEP, BECAUSE IT DOES NOT SHOW A REAL AND SINCERE DESIRE TO SEEK PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY. [END RECORDING]     COLONEL PONCE ADDED THAT THE REQUEST FOR REDUCING THE NUMBER OF TROOPS AS STATED IN THE GUERRILLA PROPOSAL IS A POLITICAL MOVE.  HE PLAYED DOWN THE LATEST REBEL OFFER PRESENTED TO THE GOVERNMENT IN MEXICO.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] THE PROPOSAL WAS AIMED AT IMPROVING THE FMLN'S IMAGE ABROAD, WHICH HAD DETERIORATED IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. THE PROPOSAL CAN BE DISCUSSED; HOWEVER, WE IN THE ARMED FORCES ARE NOT THE ONES WHO WILL DISCUSS IT OR WHO WILL DECIDE WHETHER IT CAN OR CANNOT BE ACCEPTED.  IT IS A POLITICAL DECISION, AND THE ARMED FORCES WILL ACCEPT THE DECISION MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THE MILITARY COMMANDERS ARE NOT THE ONES WHO MUST DECIDE ON THE NUMBER OF TROOPS THE INSTITUTION SHOULD HAVE.  THIS IS A DECISION TO BE MADE BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY, BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS AND THREATS THE COUNTRY MAY BE FACING. [END RECORDING]     COLONEL PONCE VISITED THE POSITIONS OF THE ARMY'S BELLOSO AND ATLACATL ELITE BATTALIONS IN THE TOWNS OF PERQUIN IN MORAZAN DEPARTMENT AND LA LAGUNA IN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, NEAR THE HONDURAN BORDER, WHERE FIGHTING IS TAKING PLACE.  DURING THIS MILITARY TOUR, COL PONCE SAID THAT IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE IS NO LIBERATED OR PERMANENTLY OCCUPIED TERRITORY IN EL SALVADOR.  HOWEVER, THE REBELS CLAIM THEY CONTROL THAT AREA OF INTENSE CONFLICT WHERE THE WAR HAS LEFT ITS INDELIBLE MARK.",

ASKING FOR AN END TO THE WAR AND NEGOTIATIONS IS LIKE DEMANDING THAT THE SITUATION BE CHANGED WITHOUT HAVING WON THE WAR.  IN ADDITION TO BEING UNREALISTIC, THIS IS A FORMULA FOR NOT NEGOTIATING AND CONTINUING THE WAR.     IN THE ESQUIPULAS II DOCUMENTS, THE GOVERNMENTS URGE THE SIDES TO AGREE TO A CEASE-FIRE.  THE TELA ACCORDS ALSO APPEAL TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FMLN IN THE SPIRIT OF THE ESQUIPULAS II ACCORDS.  THIS PARTICULAR AGREEMENT LINKS THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES TO DEMOCRATIZATION, SOCIAL JUSTICE, AND SELF-DETERMINATION AS A HARMONIOUS, INDIVISIBLE WHOLE.  THIS CONCEPT IS SUPPORTED BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL IN ITS RESOLUTION 637 OF 27 JULY 1989.  IN ADDITION, THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE MEXICAN ACCORD READS AS FOLLOWS: THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN WILL TALK IN AN EFFORT TO REACH AN UNDERSTANDING THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS TO CONCLUDE THE ARMED CONFLICT THROUGH POLITICAL MEANS AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN WILL FOSTER THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION AND REUNITE SALVADORAN SOCIETY.  THE DIALOGUE IS MEANT TO SERVE AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR REACHING AN AGREEMENT ON CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES.  THE AGREEMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT SIGNED IN MEXICO SAYS NOTHING OF TALKING ABOUT OR NEGOTIATING THE FMLN'S DEMOBILIZATION BUT MENTIONS NEGOTIATIONS TO ENCOURAGE DEMOCRATIZATION TO AGREE ON THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES.     BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, CRISTIANI IS CLOSING THE DOOR TO DEMOCRATIZATION.  THIS, PLUS HIS REFUSAL TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FMLN, MAKES HIM GUILTY OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE COMMITMENTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT MADE AT ESQUIPULAS.     3.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMMITMENT WE MADE IN MEXICO AND WITH THE REGIONAL ACCORDS, WE REITERATE OUR FULL WILLINGNESS TO AGREE WITH THE GOVERNMENT ON A CEASE-FIRE AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AND TO ATTEND THE UPCOMING NEGOTIATION MEETING IN COSTA RICA.  FOR THIS MEETING, WE HAVE INCLUDED IN OUR PEACE PROPOSAL AN AGREEMENT ON A CEASE-FIRE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING POINTS: REFORMS TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM; CESSATION OF REPRESSION; TRIAL OF BOTH THOSE GUILTY OF THE MURDER OF MONSIGNOR ARNULFO ROMERO AND THOSE FOUND TO BE MEMBERS OF THE DEATH SQUADS; ENFORCEMENT OF THE 1980 ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS; AND SUSPENSION OF THE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT EXACERBATE THE CRISIS AND THE WAR; PURGE OF THE ARMY; CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS; HOLDING THE 1991 ELECTIONS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE; MINIMUM OPERATIONAL GUARANTEES TO ESTABLISH GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS FOR THE FORCES TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE CEASE-FIRE.     AFTER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE PRESENCE OF THE UN AND OAS SECRETARY GENERALS' REPRESENTATIVES, WHO WILL SERVE AS WITNESSES AT THE DIALOGUE TABLE, CRISTIANI AGREED TO INVITE THEM TO THE COSTA RICA MEETING.  WE HOPE HE KEEPS HIS WORD BECAUSE THIS WILL LEND SERIOUSNESS TO THE PROCESS AND GUARANTEE THE NEGOTIATIONS INITIATED IN MEXICO.     SIGNED THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND",

THE SOURCE, WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY, ALSO SAID THAT THE PRESENCE OF PANAMANIAN AMBASSADOR BERTRAN SHERR IT \"CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD AS BEING OF COMMERCIAL AND PERSONAL INTEREST.\"     THE SOURCE TOLD EFE THAT THE EVENTUAL REMOVAL OF PANAMA FROM THE GROUP OF EIGHT AND ITS REPLACEMENT BY A NEW MEMBER WILL BE DECIDED THIS WEDNESDAY IN ICA (PERU) DURING THE SUMMIT OF THE PRESIDENTS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, MEXICO, PERU, URUGUAY, AND VENEZUELA.     PANAMA'S ROLE IN THE GROUP OF EIGHT HAS BEEN SUSPENDED BECAUSE OF THAT COUNTRY'S CURRENT POLITICAL SITUATION.     THE SAME SOURCE DISMISSED THE IDEA THAT PERU MAY BE PLANNING TO BREAK DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH PANAMA BECAUSE THIS WOULD AFFECT PERU'S LINKS WITH THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE AND \"THIS IS NOT THE POSITION OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT MEMBER COUNTRIES.\"     PANAMA HAS HAD AN AMBASSADOR IN PERU FOR 40 YEARS, BUT ONLY FOR \"PERSONAL REASONS\".     IN THE PRIVATE DIALOGUE WITH EFE, THE SOURCE SAID THAT \"THE PANAMANIAN AMBASSADOR SEEMINGLY DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGES SENT BY THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT THROUGH ITS RECENT ACTIONS.\"     IN EARLY SEPTEMBER THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT REMOVED ITS AMBASSADOR TO PANAMA, MR MARIO CASTRO ARENAS, FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD AND DOWNGRADED RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES TO THE LEVEL OF CHARGE D'AFFAIRES.  PERU DID THIS AFTER ANNOUNCING THAT IT WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE NEW PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT HEADED BY FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ.     ASKED IF THE PANAMANIAN DIPLOMAT WOULD BE INVITED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY, THE SOURCE SAID THAT \"THIS HAS NOT BEEN CONSIDERED BECAUSE THAT WOULD IMPLY BREAKING RELATIONS WITH PANAMA, AND PERU DOES NOT WANT TO GO THAT FAR.\"     IN COMMENTS TO A TELEVISION REPORTER LAST SUNDAY IN LIMA, FOREIGN MINISTER GUILLERMO LARCO COX SAID THAT PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA WILL PROPOSE THE DEFINITIVE EXPULSION OF PANAMA FROM THE GROUP OF EIGHT.     THE FOREIGN MINISTERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, MEXICO, URUGUAY, AND PERU BEGAN A 2-DAY MEETING IN TRUJILLO TODAY AND THEIR AGENDA INCLUDES THE SITUATION IN PANAMA, THE FIGHT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, TERRORISM, THE FOREIGN DEBT, AND THE INTEGRATION PROCESS.     TRUJILLO, 550 KILOMETERS NORTH OF LIMA, IS NORMALLY A QUIET AREA, BUT IT NOW GIVES THE IMPRESSION OF BEING A MILITARIZED CITY.  THIS MILITARY PRESENCE IS AIMED AT DETERRING SABOTAGE AND ATTACKS BY TERRORIST GROUPS.     AT LEAST 5,000 POLICEMEN AND SOLDIERS ARE GUARDING ALL ENTRANCES TO THE CITY.

ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN THE COMBINING OF THE CAMPAIGN WITH THE JUST ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL DEMANDS THAT THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES AND THE POPULAR MOVEMENT HAVE BEEN MAKING FOR THESE 16 YEARS OF DICTATORSHIP.  THESE DEMANDS ARE RELATED TO THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REPRESSION, THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE DENUNCIATION OF CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE REGIME, AND EFFORTS TO FIGHT IMMUNITY AND THE SUPPRESSION OF THE TRUTH REGARDING TORTURE, DISAPPEARANCES, AND ASSASSINATIONS. THESE QUESTIONS HAVE ONCE AGAIN COME INTO THE SPOTLIGHT NOW THAT MANY RIGHTIST CANDIDATES ARE DEMAGOGICALLY ATTEMPTING TO POSE AS DEFENDERS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND SINCE EL MERCURIO HAS REPORTED THAT THE DICTATOR IS PLANNING TO CONVERT THE CNI [NATIONAL INFORMATION CENTER] INTO AN AGENCY OF THE ARMY SO THAT THE MAIN REPRESSIVE BODY FROM ALL THESE YEARS CAN BE UNDER HIS DIRECT CONTROL.  JAIME INZUNZA, LEADER OF THE UNITED LEFT AND THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE, DISCUSSES THESE TOPICS OVER A DIRECT PHONE LINE FROM SANTIAGO, CHILE.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [ANNOUNCER] HOW ARE THE CHILEAN PEOPLE'S DEMANDS CONNECTED TO THE ONGOING ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN?     [INZUNZA] THEY ARE CONNECTED THROUGH THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD BOARDS DURING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS; THE STRENGTHENING OF THE UNIFIED ACTIONS OF WORKERS; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMITTEES FOR VICTORY, WHICH WILL ALSO BE COMMITTEES FOR THE DEFENSE OF VICTORY AND COMMITTEES FOR CARRYING ON THE DEMOCRATIC TASK; THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONFIDENCE; THE STRUGGLE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING TRUTH AND JUSTICE AND IMMUNITY FOR CRIMES; THE INCREASING PRESSURE BY THE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION FOR THE RELEASE OF ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS; AND NATURALLY FOR THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CNI. ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE BEING BROUGHT UP IN THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, AND AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN REACHED WITHIN SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THIS WAS EVIDENCED A WEEK AGO BY THE SALVADORA STRIKE AND BY THE CURRENT STRIKE BY COAL MINERS.  THIS PROVES THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN HAS TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF THEIR ACTIVITIES AND A WAY TO STRENGTHEN THEIR SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE FUTURE STRUGGLE. [END RECORDING]     THE PRECEDING COMMENTS WERE MADE BY COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE LEADER JAIME INZUNZA, WHO HAS BEEN INTERVIEWED OVER THE TELEPHONE ON OUR PROGRAM \"ESCUCHA CHILE.\"  ANOTHER TOPIC DISCUSSED BY INZUNZA WAS THE EL MERCURIO REPORT ON THE CNI'S TRANSFER TO THE ARMY.  THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CNI HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING DEMANDS OF THE IMMENSE MAJORITY OF CHILEANS.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [ANNOUNCER] WHAT IS YOUR OPINION, JAIME INZUNZA, ON THE DICTATOR'S INTENTION TO MAINTAIN THE CNI AS IT IS AND TO KEEP IT UNDER HIS DIRECT COMMAND?     [INZUNZA] I BELIEVE THAT THIS ISSUE IS PARTICULARLY SERIOUS.  THE INTENTION IS TO MAINTAIN INTACT THE MAIN TERRORIST APPARATUS OF THE DICTATORSHIP, WHICH HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MOST FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS OF ITS EXISTENCE.  I UNDERSTAND THAT THE DINA [NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE, REPLACED BY CNI] AND THE CNI HAVE BEEN IN FACT A SINGLE APPARATUS AND THEREFORE THE MAIN ORGANS OF STATE TERRORRISM OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS.  IF TRANSFERRED TO THE ARMY, THE CNI WOULD CONTINUE TO BE UNDER PINOCHET'S ORDERS.  UNDER WHOSE ORDERS HAS IT BEEN ALL THESE YEARS?  FOR WHOM HAS IT BEEN A DIRECT AGENT ALL THESE YEARS?  HENCEFORTH IT WILL BE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE OFFICE OF THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMY. [END RECORDING]     COMMUNIST LEADER JAIME INZUNZA ADDED THAT PINOCHET'S INTENT IN TRANSFERRING THE CNI TO THE ARMY'S DIRECT COMMAND IS TO MAKE THE INSTITUTION AN ACCOMPLICE IN CONCEALING PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR CRIMES AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [INZUNZA] THE IDEA IS TO INVOLVE THE MILITARY INSTITUTION IN CRIMES FOR WHICH THE CHILEAN PEOPLE KNOWS IT WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE.  THIS IS CLEAR: WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION FORCES WANT IS TO HAVE THE CULPRITS BEHIND THOSE CRIMES AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS PROSECUTED, NOT THE MILITARY INSTITUTION.  THE TRANSFER OF THE CNI TO THE ARMY IS AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE MEN IN UNIFORM ACT AS ACCOMPLICES OR ACCESSORIES TO THOSE CRIMES.  LOYALTY IS NOT AT STAKE HERE; LOYALTY IS DEFENDING VALUES AND PRINCIPLES, NOT SOME SORT OF CRIMINAL COMPLICITY THAT IS NOT IN LINE WITH THE TRAINING OF THESE MEN.  THIS SEEMS TO ME TO BE PARTICULARLY SERIOUS BECAUSE THIS TRANSFER IMPLIES MAINTAINING THE CNI UNDER THE ORDERS OF THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIMES COMMITTED ALL THESE YEARS, THE DICTATOR HIMSELF. [END RECORDING]     THESE HAVE BEEN ANSWERS GIVEN BY JAIME INZUNZA, UNITED LEFT AND COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE LEADER, TO QUESTIONS PUT TO HIM OVER THE PHONE BY \"ESCUCHA CHILE,\" A RADIO MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM.",

THE ARCHBISHOP ALSO REPORTED THAT ANOTHER U.S. NUN, PATRICIA DENNY, LEFT GUATEMALA 17 DAYS AGO BECAUSE OF CONTINUOUS DEATH THREATS OVER THE TELEPHONE AND IN WRITING.     PENADOS SAID DIANA MACK ORTIZ WAS KIDNAPPED ON 2 NOVEMBER IN ANTIGUA GUATEMALA, 45 KM SOUTH OF GUATEMALA CITY, WHEN SHE WAS ATTENDING A SEMINAR ALONG WITH OTHER NUNS.  THE ARCHBISHOP EXPLAINED THE NUN HAD BEEN RECEIVING DEATH THREATS.  SHE HAD BEEN URGED TO LEAVE GUATEMALA, BUT SHE DECIDED TO CONTINUE WORKING IN THIS COUNTRY.     THE KIDNAPPED NUN, WHO HAD BEEN IN GUATEMALA FOR A YEAR, WAS TEACHING AT THE SAN MIGUEL ACATAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN HUEHUETENANGO DEPARTMENT IN NORTHEAST GUATEMALA.  SHE BELONGS TO THE ORDER OF THE URSILINA, PENADOS REPORTED.     PATRICIA DENNY, 54, LEFT GUATEMALA AFTER UNIDENTIFIED MEN WARNED HER THAT IF SHE WISHED TO CONTINUE LIVING SHE HAD TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY.  DENNY HAD ARRIVED IN GUATEMALA IN 1984, BELONGED TO THE SISTERS OF MARY KNOLL, AND WAS WORKING AT A PARISH IN MIXCO MUNICIPALITY IN SOUTHERN GUATEMALA CITY.     THE ARCHBISHOP SAID ALL THIS IS THE \"BEGINNING OF A CAMPAIGN TO INTIMIDATE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.\"  HE DID NOT MENTION WHICH GROUPS ARE PERPETRATING THESE INTIMIDATION ACTIONS.  HOWEVER, PENADOS SAID HE IS GOING TO TALK TO GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO TODAY TO REPORT THE INCIDENTS WITH THE U.S. NUNS.     PENADOS STATED THAT THIS KIND OF ACTION \"HARMED CATHOLICISM VERY MUCH IN PAST YEARS,\" WHEN REPRESSION SEVERELY HIT THIS SECTOR.  HE POINTED OUT THAT THIS KIND OF INCIDENT HAD NOT HAPPENED SINCE PRESIDENT CEREZO TOOK OVER POWER IN GUATEMALA ON 14 JANUARY 1986.     THE ARCHBISHOP DEMANDED THAT MACK ORTIZ' KIDNAPPERS RESPECT HER LIFE AND PHYSICAL INTEGRITY.",

COMMANDER AMILCAR, ONE OF THE REBEL CHIEFS WHO HAS OCCUPIED THE ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD, TOLD ACAN - EFE THAT HE AND HIS MEN CAME TO SAN SALVADOR \"PREPARED, AND WITH SUFFICIENT AMMUNITION TO REMAIN FOR SEVERAL DAYS.\"     IN A GENERAL ASSESEMENT OF THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE, THE YOUNG COMMANDER SAID THAT THE ARMY \"CANNOT ENTER\" THE \"AREA UNDER REBEL CONTROL,\" BUT IT IS ATTACKING THE REBELS FROM THE NATIONAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS AND USING HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS.     \"HOWEVER, THE PEOPLE HAVE THE TRUMP CARD (FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE OFFENSIVE),\" HE ADDED.     AMILCAR, WHO IS 26-YEARS-AGO AND LOOKS LIKE A STUDENT, WAS WALKING DOWN THE HALLWAYS OF ONE OF THE CRAMPED FIVE-STORY APARTMENT BUILDINGS IN ZACAMIL WHILE EXPLAINING THAT THE GOAL OF THE REBEL OFFENSIVE IS \"TO SEEK OPTIONS FOR BUILDING PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.\"     HE ADDED THAT THE GUERRILLAS SEEK \"TO DISRUPT THE DIALOGUE CONDITIONS, AND GO TO THE CONVERSATIONS WITH A POLITICAL AND MILITARY ADVANTAGE SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL AGREE WITH US ON WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT: DEMOCRACY, A PEOPLE'S ECONOMIC POLICY, AND A PURGE IN THE ARMED FORCES, AMONG OTHER THINGS.\"     THE GUERRILLAS AND THE GOVERNMENT OF EL SALVADOR HAVE HELD TWO MEETINGS IN RECENT MONTHS, THE FIRST ONE IN MEXICO AND THE SECOND ONE IN COSTA RICA.  A THIRD MEETING WAS TO BE HELD SHORTLY IN VENEZUELA, BUT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL NOT ATTEND.     THE FMLN LAUNCHED THE MOST IMPORTANT MILITARY OFFENSIVE SINCE 1981 ON 11 NOVEMBER, ATTACKING 50 MILITARY POSITIONS, 20 OF THEM IN SAN SALVADOR.     IN THE FIRST 24 HOURS, THE OFFENSIVE HAS CAUSED NEARLY 300 CASUALTIES (127 DEAD AND 155 WOUNDED) ACCORDING TO THE ARMY, AND OVER 400 CASUALTIES ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS.     THE OFFENSIVE HAS BEEN NAMED \"OUT WITH THE FASCISTS! FEBE ELIZABETH LIVES!\" IN HOMAGE TO A TRADE UNION LEADER KILLED 13 DAYS AGO ALONG WITH NINE OTHER WORKERS IN A DYNAMITE EXPLOSION IN THE CAPITAL CITY ATTRIBUTED TO THE ULTRARIGHTIST DEATH SQUADS.     ARMED WITH AN AUTOMATIC AK-47 RIFLE, AMILCAR SAID THAT THE FMLN \"HAS CONSOLIDATED THE ZACAMIL, CUSCATANCINGO, MEJICANOS, AND PANAMA NEIGHBORHOODS, AND WE HAVE BESIEGED THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE.\"     ALL THE PLACES HE MENTIONED ARE IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE BLOODIEST CLASHES BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS HAVE TAKEN PLACE.     AT NIGHTFALL ON 12 NOVEMBER AND PRIOR TO THE CURFEW THAT BEGINS AT 2000 (0200 GMT), THE RESIDENTS OF ZACAMIL WERE OUTSIDE THEIR BUILDINGS CARRYING CANDLES AS THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY.     AMILCAR ASSURED THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAVE INFLICTED AT LEAST 18 CASUALTIES ON THE ARMED FORCES IN THAT AREA AND HAVE SEIZED ABOUT 20 RIFLES AND 1 M-60 MACHINEGUN.     \"THIS OFFENSIVE IS A MILITARY AND POLITICAL ACHIEVEMENT.

REFERRING TO THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION TO IMPOSE A CURFEW AND A NATIONWIDE STATE OF SIEGE EFFECTIVE TONIGHT, COMMANDER AMILCAR SAID: \"WE HAD ALREADY TAKEN THIS INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN WE LAUNCHED THE OFFENSIVE.\"     THE GOVERNMENT \"CANNOT ACT INDISCRIMINATELY AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION,\" AMILCAR SAID; ADDING THAT \"THE CITIZENS' RIGHTS WERE SUSPENDED TO BOMB THE PLACES TAKEN OVER BY OUR FORCES.\"     THE PEOPLE OF ZACAMIL AND OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS LOCATED NORTH OF THE CAPITAL HAVE LIVED IN TERROR SINCE SATURDAY, 11 NOVEMBER, WHEN THEY WERE TRAPPED IN THE CROSSFIRE BETWEEN THE REBELS AND THE MILITARY, SUBJECTED TO THE AIR RAIDS AND THE THREAT THAT LIVING WITH THE GUERRILLA MEMBERS REPRESENTS TO THEM.     AT LEAST TWO CIVILIANS HAVE DIED IN ZACAMIL AND FIVE MORE HAVE BEEN WOUNDED, INCLUDING TWO CHILDREN, AS A RESULT OF THE ARMED CLASHES.",

THIS REPORT IS INCLUDED IN A GOVERNMENT DECREE APPROVED BY PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA.     ACCORDING TO INTERIOR MINISTRY UNDER SECRETARY RAUL LOAYZA, POLICE ARRESTED 500 TEACHERS AND EDUCATION LEADERS IN THE NINE DEPARTMENTAL CAPITALS, THUS THWARTING THE EXTENDED HUNGER STRIKE.     THE STRIKE BY TEACHERS, WHO HAVE BEEN DEMANDING A BONUS OF 300 BOLIVIAN PESOS, HAS UNLEASHED VIOLENT STREET CONFRONTATIONS OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS AND AT LEAST FOUR BOMBINGS.     THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN BESIEGED BY A WAVE OF SOCIAL DEMANDS AND PRESSURED BY THE 80,000 TEACHERS, HAS STATED THAT THESE DEMONSTRATIONS ARE UNDERMINING DEMOCRATIC STABILITY. IT ADDED THAT DESPITE EFFORTS TO FIND A PATH TO PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE AND DIALOGUE, IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO PREVENT RADICAL GROUPS INTERESTED IN THE UNION LEADERSHIP FROM PUBLICLY CHALLENGING THE GOVERNMENT.     THE GOVERNMENT DECREE STATES THAT IT WILL GUARANTEE THE 3 DECEMBER MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS AND PROTECT THE CITIZENS' RIGHT TO VOTE.     A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE RELEASE OF THIS DECREE TO THE PRESS, POLICE PATROLS RAIDED THE CENTERS WHERE THE HUNGER STRIKES WERE TAKING PLACE.  POLICE USED EXCESSIVE FORCE IN THESE RAIDS.     THE 250 STRIKERS ARRESTED IN LA PAZ WERE TAKEN IN TRUCKS AND BUSES OF THE POLICE, THE AIR FORCE, AND OTHER STATE INSTITUTIONS, TO THE EL ELTO AIR BASE.     THE GOVERNMENT REPORTED THAT 250 STRIKERS WERE ALSO ARRESTED IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY. IT ADDED THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STRIKE WILL BE SENT TO DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY. OTHER, LESS RESPONSIBLE GROUPS OF STRIKERS WILL BE TRIED BY THE REGULAR COURTS. OTHERS WILL BE RELEASED.     THE THREE LA PAZ TEACHERS' LEADERS HAVE BEEN SENT TO DIFFERENT HOSPITALS IN LA PAZ AND PLACED IN INTENSIVE CARE. THEY ARE MIGUEL LORA, TELMO ROMAN, AND LUIS ALVAREZ, WHO ARE NOT FACING ANY RISK OF DEATH, THE INTERIOR MINISTRY UNDER SECRETARY STATED.  HE WARNED THAT THE BOLIVIAN LABOR CONFEDERATION UNDERGROUND SESSIONS WILL BE ILLEGAL, AND THEY ARE NOT THE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR LABOR ORGANIZATIONS, HE SAID.     THIS IS THE FIRST SOCIAL CRISIS PRESIDENT PAZ ZAMORA HAS HAD TO FACE SINCE HE ASSUMED POWER ALMOST 100 DAYS AGO.",

AN OFFENSIVE WAS LAUNCHED SIMULTANEOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY'S TERRITORY; HOWEVER, SAN SALVADOR'S CITY BLOCKS, WHICH WERE THE SCENE OF FIERCE FIGHTING BETWEEN FMLN DETACHMENTS AND GOVERNMENT TROOPS, WERE THE EPICENTER OF SUNDAY'S EVENTS.  THE INTENSE FIREFIGHT INVOLVING ARTILLERY AND HELICOPTERS LASTED APPROXIMATELY 18 HOURS AND ENCOMPASSED VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE CAPITAL, COMPLETELY PARALYZING LIFE IN THE CITY.  ACCORDING TO REUTER, ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO STORM PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S OFFICIAL AND PERSONAL RESIDENCES; HOWEVER, IT IS REPORTED THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT HURT.

ACCORDING TO THE INSURGENTS, THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED ON DIALOGUE WITH THEM SOLELY OUT OF PROPAGANDA CONSIDERATIONS, WITH NO INTENTION OF REACHING ANY AGREEMENT.  SUNDAY'S OFFENSIVE WAS THUS AN ATTEMPT ON THEIR PART TO SHOW THEMSELVES TO BE A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH.     IN THE OPINION OF OBSERVERS, HOWEVER, EVENTS IN SAN SALVADOR PRACTICALLY RULE OUT ALL HOPES OF SUCCESS FOR FUTURE TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE INSURGENTS.

THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THE BOMBINGS AFTER CYNICALLY SAYING IT KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THEM.  HOWEVER, THAT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT IS EVEN MORE HAIR-RAISING THAN THE DENIAL.  HEAR US WELL: THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS STATED THAT IT SUPPORTS THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS' EFFORTS TO CRUSH THE OFFENSIVE WHICH HAS CAUSED SO MANY PERSONAL TRAGEDIES; AND IT PRAISED THE ARMY FOR DECREEING STRICT LAWS TO PREVENT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.     WE ALSO HEAR THE PET EXPRESSION THAT THE FMLN IS USING CIVILIANS TO PROTECT ITS FIGHTERS, AND THE PRINCIPLE OF REMOVING THE PEOPLE FROM THEIR ENVIRONMENT IS UNSCRUPULOUSLY APPLIED ONCE MORE.  THIS IS WHY THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY WAS DESTROYED, LEAVING ENTIRE TOWNS IN RUINS -- AND NOW LARGE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST IMPORTANT CITIES ARE BEING DESTROYED.  ONE DAY THOSE RUINS WILL BECOME THE EVIDENCE WE WILL SHOW OUR CHILDREN TO PROVE THAT FASCISM ONCE EXISTED IN THE COUNTRY.     HOWEVER, THE U.S. IMPERIALISM'S CLUMSINESS GOES EVEN FURTHER.  THE NORTH AMERICANS APPARENTLY WANT TO BECOME INVOLVED IN A LARGE-SCALE CONFLICT -- FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW DEATH SQUAD MEMBERS WHO HAVE ALREADY EARNED THE WORLD'S SCORN -- GIVEN THE DECISION TO SEND U.S.  PILOTS TO BOMB THE CIVILIAN POPULATION BY NIGHT.  THE FASCIST SALVADORAN DICTATORSHIP HAS UNLEASHED THE BRUTAL TACTICS USED BY SOMOZA BEFORE LEAVING POWER.  ON THAT OCCASION THE U.S. IMPERIALISM TURNED ITS BACK ON THE TYRANT.     THE UNITED STATES' FOREIGN POLICY HAVE NEVER STOOPED SO LOW AND THE DECISIONS ADOPTED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAVE NEVER BROUGHT THE POSSIBILITY OF A REGIONAL CONFLICT SO CLOSE.  WHAT DOES THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT THINK ABOUT THE AIRPLANES BEING FLOWN BY U.S.  PILOTS ONLY A FEW HUNDRED KM FROM ITS BORDER?  WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF GUATEMALA CONTINUES TO INVOLVE ITSELF IN THE SALVADORAN CONFLICT?  THE CONSEQUENCES ARE UNFORESEEABLE.  THE U.S. IMPERIALISM HAS SOILED ITS HANDS WITH A NEW GENOCIDE IN EL SALVADOR.  THE U.S. PEOPLE SHOULD DEEPLY REFLECT ABOUT THIS AND STOP THEIR GOVERNMENT FROM PROVOKING CONTEMPT OF THAT NATION -- WHICH IS BEING DISINFORMED AND INTOXICATED BY THE ANTI-COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA.     LARGE GROUPS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S PEOPLE, THE BEST SONS OF THE UNITED STATES, HAVE REACTED AND HAVE TAKEN TO THE STREETS --DEEP INSIDE THE U.S. IMPERIALISM'S HEART.  SOON, VERY SOON, THIS WILL BECOME AN UNSTOPPABLE SURGE.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGIC GOAL IS CLEAR: THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WANTS THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO [WORDS INDISTINCT].  TO QUOTE MONSIGNOR [OSCAR ARNULFO] ROMERO, THE ARMY -- AND IN THIS CASE THE NORTH AMERICANS -- ARE LIKE SERPENTS, WHICH ONLY BITE THE SHOELESS.  YET THEY DO NOT KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE RISEN IN ANGER AND DIGNITY, AND THEY ARE COMING TO PULL OUT THE FASCIST SERPENT'S FANGS.",

WE HAVE BROKEN THE DEFENSIVE LINES OF THE ENEMY.  WE HAVE BROKEN [WORDS INDISTINCT] IN THE CAPITAL CITY, WE ARE FIGHTING IN FRONT OF THE DENS OF COLONEL PONCE AND OTHER OFFICERS WHO HAVE TURNED THE WAR INTO A BUSINESS. THOSE OFFICERS HAVE LUXURIOUS MANSIONS IN MIAMI.  EVERY WEEKEND AND EVEN IN SPITE OF THE WAR, COL PONCE HAS ORGIES IN HIS LUXURIOUS HOMES IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR.  SOLDIERS, PATRIOTIC OFFICERS, WE CALL ON YOU TO JOIN THE PEOPLE AND JOIN OUR FRONT.  PATRIOTIC OFFICERS, WHO ARE LISTENING TO US, DO NOT ALLOW MORE BOMBINGS IN OUR CAPITAL CITY BY THE GENOCIDAL TANDONA GROUP [1966 GRADUATING CLASS OF THE CAPT GEN GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY SCHOOL].  YOUNG OFFICERS, LIEUTENANTS WHO ARE BEING KILLED IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS AND NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE CAPITAL CITY, WHY SHOULD YOU BE KILLED WHILE DEFENDING PONCE'S MANSIONS?  THIS IS THE LAST SCENARIO OF THE LAST CHAPTER IN WHICH THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WILL ACHIEVE THE VICTORY OF THE PEOPLE.  WE CALL ON YOUR CONSCIENCE, YOUNG PATRIOTIC OFFICER.     JUST LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BOMBINGS OF ZACAMIL.  OVER 500 HOMES WERE RAZED.  ARE YOU GOING TO ALLOW THE HIGH COMMAND TO FINISH OFF THE CITY, TO FINISH OFF THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS WHERE YOUR RELATIVES MIGHT BE?  YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN ZACAMIL, MEJICANOS, SOYAPANGO.  PATRIOTIC OFFICER, IT IS TIME WE SIT DOWN TO TALK, TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO WITH OUR FATHERLAND, AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH LA TANDONA.  PATRIOTIC OFFICERS WHO ARE LISTENING TO US: IT IS USELESS TO CONTINUE DEFENDING; TO CONTINUE DEFENDING WHAT, WE ASK YOU.  THE FATHERLAND?  WHAT FATHERLAND?  THE FATHERLAND YOU ARE TOLD YOU ARE DEFENDING ARE THE MILLIONS AND THE MANSIONS OF COL PONCE AND OF COL ELENA FUENTES.  PATRIOTIC OFFICERS: THE TIME IS HERE, TAKE ONE STEP FORWARD.     WE HAVE MORE REPORTS FROM SAN SALVADOR: EARLY THIS MORNING, COMBAT HAS BEEN RESUMED IN THE FOLLOWING PLACES: ESCALON, SAN BENITO, AND LA SULTANA RESIDENTIAL AREAS.  THESE ATTACKS ARE AGAINST THE SOLDIERS FROM MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6 AND THE CAVALRY.  COMBATS ARE ALSO REPORTED NORTH OF AYUTUXTEPEQUE, AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM THE 4TH AND 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE.  THERE ARE ALSO CLASHES IN THE AREA OF METROPOLIS AND ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOODS AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM THE BRACAMONTE BATTALION.     IT IS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT IN SAN BENITO AND LA SULTANA RESIDENTIAL AREAS, WE ARE FIGHTING AGAINST SOLDIERS FROM SONSONATE, AND NOT FROM SAN SALVADOR.  THE SOLDIERS ARE FROM MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6 OF SONSONATE.  TROOPS FROM SONSONATE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO SAN SALVADOR, BECAUSE THE HIGH COMMAND HAS LOST CONTROL OF THE SITUATION. IN OTHER WORDS, THERE IS A MIXTURE OF SOLDIERS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IN THE CAPITAL CITY.  THIS HAS YIELDED NEGATIVE RESULTS FOR THE HIGH COMMAND.  IN THE CAPITAL CITY, THERE HAVE BEEN CLASHES BETWEEN THE ATLACATL BATTALION AND THE NATIONAL POLICE, AND THE NATIONAL GUARD HAS ATTACKED TROOPS FROM MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6. THESE ARE LITTLE SOLDIERS FROM SONSONATE WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE CAPITAL CITY, AND THEY ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE CITY.  THEY ARE CLASHING AGAINST EACH OTHER.     CLASHES ARE ALSO REPORTED WITH THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE AND THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE IS FIGHTING IN AYUTUXTEPEQUE.  WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY?  THE GARRISONS HAVE BEEN LEFT EMPTY.  THE SAN FRANCISCO GOTERA GARRISON HAS BEEN LEFT WITHOUT ANYONE.  THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE IS BEING LEFT BY ITSELF, AS WELL AS THE MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 1.  THE COLONELS ARE DESPERATE AND ARE BRINGING TROOPS INTO THE CAPITAL CITY.     THIS IS A GOOD REPORT.  THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE AND MILITARY DETACHMENT NO. 6 ARE IN THE CAPITAL.  THIS IS THE SITUATION ON THIS MORNING OF VICTORIOUS BATTLES.  WHO WOULD BELIEVE IT?  THE SONSONATE SOLDIERS ARE FIGHTING IN THE CAPITAL CITY.  THIS GIVES US A GENERAL PICTURE OF THE DEFEAT.  IF THE SONSONATE TROOPS ARE FIGHTING IN THE LAST DEFENSIVE LINE, THIS MEANS THAT THE SONSONATE LINES HAVE BEEN WIPED OUT.     ATTENTION, FMLN ANTIAIRCRAFT UNITS HAVE OPENED FIRE WITH THEIR M-60 MACHINEGUNS AGAINST UH-1H HELICOPTERS THAT ARE FLYING OVER THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS OF THE OLIGARCHY.  LIKEWISE, A HELICOPTER IS RIGHT NOW FLYING OVER THE ARMED FORCES GENERAL STAFF OFFICES.  FMLN UNITS ARE FIRING THEIR ANTI-AIRCRAFT WEAPONS IN THE ESCALON RESIDENTIAL AREA.",

NEWSMEN WHO ENTERED THE HOTEL THIS AFTERNOON DURING THE EVACUATION OF BAENA BY DIPLOMATS WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT COMMANDER AMILCAR, KNOWN AS \"EL CHOCO,\" WHO DIRECTED THE COMBAT OPERATIONS IN THE ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD, WAS SEEN TODAY ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE SHERATON HOTEL.

PRESIDENT BUSH GETS ON THE PHONE AND CALLS HIS SALVADORAN CRONY ALFREDO CRISTINI TO ASSURE HIM THAT EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT, THAT HE CAN GO ON, THAT THE U.S.  POSITION IS FAVORABLE TO HIS REGIME.  THE HUMAN RIGHTS CHAMPION ASKS NO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RECENT BRUTAL KILLINGS OF UNION LEADERS BY THE ARMY.  BUSH ASKS NO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MASSACRE OF SPANISH PRIESTS.  THE PRESIDENT ONLY PRAISES THE ARMY, THE AIR FORCE, THE POLICE AND PARAMILITARY EFFORTS TO STOP THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE.

BUT, SOLIDARITY WITH WHOM?  ALL WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT UP TO NOW ARE THE PROTESTS PROVOKED IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE U.S.  MILITARY AID TO THE SALVADORAN REGIME. THE ONLY REALITIES ARE THE DEMONSTRATIONS STAGED FROM LOS ANGELES TO NEW YORK TO REPUDIATE THE U.S. AID.  THE ONLY FACT IS THAT THE HUMAN RIGHTS CHAMPION IS BEING PUBLICLY QUESTIONED ABOUT THIS AID.  THE ONLY PICTURE THAT HAS BEEN DISSEMINATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IS THAT OF A WOMAN WHO INTERRUPTS BUSH'S SPEECH TO SHOUT TO HIM: WHY ARE WE SENDING MONEY TO EL SALVADOR? WHY ARE WE KILLING PRIESTS IN EL SALVADOR?  IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO OVERLOOK THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY IN THE CURRENT SALVADORAN SITUATION.

THE FMLN LAUNCHED THIS AGGRESSION WITH ALL OF ITS FORCES, CHIEFLY USING A CONCENTRATION OF WEAPONS AND FIGHTERS IN THE SAN SALVADOR METROPOLITAN ZONE, IN ZACATECOLUCA, LA PAZ DEPARTMENT, AND AT TIMES IN USULUTAN CITY, USULUTAN DEPARMENT, AND IN SAN MIGUEL CITY, SAN MIGUEL DEPARTMENT.  IN THIS AGGRESSION THE FMLN DISPLAYED ITS WEAPONRY.  IT DISPLAYED AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WEAPONS, WHICH....[CHANGES THOUGHT] BY THE WAY, IN RECENT DAYS THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE BEGUN A NUMBER OF SEARCHES IN SOME HOUSES WHERE IT IS BELIEVED THAT SOME OF THESE WEAPONS WERE LOCATED. WE HAVE ALREADY FOUND LARGE AMOUNTS OF WEAPONS.     IN ADDITION, THE FMLN LAUNCHED AN AGGRESSION AND HID BEHIND YOU, SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  IT USED YOU AS A SHIELD, WANTING TO CONVEY THE IDEA THAT THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THAT THE PEOPLE HERE WOULD RISE UP TO SUPPORT THEM.  THEY HAVE REALIZED THAT THIS VIEW IS TOTALLY FALSE.  FAR FROM SUPPORTING THE FMLN, THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, SALVADORAN BROTHERS, SUPPORTED THE ARMED FORCES IN THE TREMENDOUS EFFORT IT HAS CONDUCTED TO REPEL THE FMLN AGGRESSION.     HOWEVER, WE MUST NOW CONSIDER A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER.  IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT AN AGGRESSION OF THIS SIZE WITHOUT SUPPORT FROM SOMEONE ABROAD.  ON THIS OCCASION, WE ARE CERTAIN THAT THIS SUPPORT CAME FROM NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ORTEGA AND CUBAN PRESIDENT CASTRO, BUT CHIEFLY FROM ORTEGA WHO IS TRYING TO RAISE A SMOKESCREEN IN THE FACE OF THE REAL POSSIBILITY THAT MRS VIOLETTA CHAMORRO MAY DEFEAT HIM IN THE ELECTIONS, AND BECAUSE THE FMLN HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PUPPET OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNIST AGGRESSION IN WHICH ORTEGA AND CASTRO PARTICIPATE.  IF THIS IS NOT SO, LET US TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED.  DURING THOSE TIMES WHEN YOU WERE SUFFERING MOMENTS OF ANGUISH LAST WEEK, YOU WERE ABLE TO SEE THE LARGE NUMBER OF FOREIGNERS WHO WERE SUPPORTING THE FMLN TERRORISTS.  WE HAVE ALSO MANAGED TO COLLECT EVIDENCE THAT THE ORTEGA GOVERNMENT TRAINED FMLN FIGHTERS IN THE USE OF CERTAIN KINDS OF WEAPONRY, SPECIFICALLY THE GRENADE LAUNCHERS.     WHAT HAPPENED?  IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS WE BEGAN NOTICING WHAT KIND OF WEAPONS WERE BEING USED.  IN THE FOILED ATTACK ON THE PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE, A SUBSEQUENT ATTACK ON THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES' JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, AND LASTLY, AN ATTACK ON THE NATIONAL GUARD GARRISON PARTICULAR KINDS OF WEAPONS WERE BEING USED.  AS A RESULT OF THE SAVAGE ACTION BY FMLN, TWO LITTLE GIRLS WERE KILLED.  MOREOVER, LET US RECALL AND SEE THE CONNECTION THAT EXISTS WITH ALL THE SHIPMENTS THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HAVE BEEN STOPPING BETWEEN NICARAGUAN AND EL SALVADOR.  ONE SHIPMENT WAS MADE PRIOR TO THE VISIT WE PRESIDENTS MADE TO COSTA RICA.  IN THAT COUNTRY, WE DENOUNCED ORTEGA FOR CONTINUING TO SEND WEAPONS AND SUPPORTING THE FMLN IN AN OPEN VIOLATION OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEACE PROCESS.     AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED LATELY?  ON 25 NOVEMBER, SALVADORAN PEOPLE, TWO LIGHT AIRPLANES COMING FROM NICARAGUA WERE DISCOVERED.  THEIR FLIGHT COURSE INDICATES THAT THEY CAME FROM NICARAGUA, ESPECIALLY THE ONE WHERE THE WEAPONS WERE FOUND.  AS ADDITIONAL PROOF, WE HAVE A DOCUMENT SHOWING THAT ONE LIGHT AIRCRAFT BELONGS TO THE SETA TRANSPORTATION COMPANY LOCATED IN NICARAGUA'S AUGUSTO CESAR SANDINO AIRPORT.  IT WAS BRINGING SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT FOR THE FMLN.  IN THAT AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT, FOUR PEOPLE WERE KILLED: THE PILOT WHO WAS WEARING CIVILIAN CLOTHES AND THREE OTHER PEOPLE WERE WEARING MILITARY UNIFORMS; I MEAN CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORMS LIKE THE ONES WORN IN MANY COUNTRIES, AND LIKE THE ONES THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCE USE.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT TWO OF THOSE PEOPLE DIED AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT ANOTHER PERSON KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE HAD A WEAPON IN HIS HAND AND A BULLET WOUND IN FOREHEAD.  HE KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE SAW HIMSELF IMPLICATED IN THIS SITUATION.  [CONTINUED]",

AS WE HAVE REPORTED, THE GENERAL STAFF RESPONDED WITH A 4-PRONGED DELAYED RESPONSE.  THE ARMED FORCES ATTACKED FROM FOUR ADVANCED POSITIONS, ONE HELD BY THE BRACAMONTE BATTALION, WHICH ADVANCED TOWARD ESCALON; IT WAS NEUTRALIZED BY OUR AMBUSHES.  OUR UNITS ARE ENTRENCHED IN THE MANSIONS OF THE OLIGARCHS IN THAT SECTOR OF ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD.  THEY AMBUSHED AND REPELLED ATTACKS FROM THE VANGUARD POSITIONS LAUNCHED BY THE ARMED FORCES.  THE SECOND DIRECTION IN WHICH THE ENEMY RESPONDED TO OUR PRESENCE WAS DIRECTED ON THE SOUTHERN FREEWAY.  THIS SECOND POSITION WAS AMBUSHED WITH RPG-7 ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND MACHINEGUN FIRE.  THE THIRD ENEMY POSITION, WHICH WAS ADVANCING ON SANTA TECLA, WAS AMBUSHED AT LA UNIVERSAL POINT AND WAS ALSO NEUTRALIZED.  THE ATLACATL BATTALION DEPLOYMENT ALONG GUADALUPE GARDENS WAS ALSO NEUTRALIZED.  OUR BATTALIONS ARE STAGING SABOTAGE ACTIONS ON ELECTRICITY POSTS IN THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS.     ALSO, WE HAVE A NEW REPORT WHICH INDICATES THAT FMLN UNITS HAVE SET UP DOWNED ELECTRICITY POSTS AS BARRICADES ALONG THE SOUTH FREEWAY AND IN THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD.  WE REPEAT, ALONG THE SOUTH FREEWAY AND IN THE ESCALON NEIGHBORHOOD, FMLN UNITS HAVE USED DOWNED ELECTRICITY POSTS AND VEHICLES AS BARRICADES.     THIS IS THE SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR.  THROUGHOUT THE NORTHERN SECTOR OF THE CAPITAL, OUR UNITS ARE MAINTAINING POSITIONS.  THE TROOPS IN THE INTERIOR PART OF THE REPUBLIC IN THAT NORTHERN REGION REFUSE TO ADVANCE TOWARD OUR POSITIONS, WHILE OUR UNITS ARE EXTENDING ALONG THE NORTHWESTERN AND SOUTHWESTERN REGION OF THE CAPITAL.  OUR UNITS ARE EXTENDING AND MOVING FOWARD ALONG THESE ZONES.  THE AIR FORCE HAS OPENED FIRE ON SOME OF OUR POSITIONS IN THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS.  WE REITERATE THE CALL TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS TO ABANDON ALL THOSE ZONES IMMEDIATELY.  THE AIR FORCE IS BEGINNING NEW AIR RAIDS ON FMLN POSITIONS IN THOSE REGIONS.  THEREFORE, WE CALL ON THE INHABITANTS OF THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS TO LEAVE THOSE AREAS.",

THE IDENTITY OF THE CREWMEN IN THE NICARAGUAN PLANES THAT CRASHED IN EL SALVADOR OVER THE PAST WEEKEND CARRYING SOVIET ARMS IS A STATE SECRET ACCEDED TO BY LA PRENSA THIS MORNING AFTER GETTING IN TOUCH WITH A HIGH-RANKING SOURCE IN THE SANDINIST ARMY.  THE SOURCE DISCLOSED FURTHER DETAILS OF THE BUTTERFLY OPERATION.  THE ARMY SOURCE, WHICH OF COURSE REQUESTED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS, CONFIRMED THAT THE PLANE THAT CRASHED IN SAN MIGUEL BELONGS TO NICARAGUA AND THAT THE PLANE'S REGISTRATION IS YANKEE NOVEMBER BRAVO YANKEE KILO.     THERE ARE NO REPORTS SO FAR AS TO WHETHER ANY RELATIVES HAVE CLAIMED THE BODIES OF THE FOUR MILITARY MEN WHO WERE REPORTEDLY KILLED WHEN THE PLANE CRASHED. THREE OF THE CREWMEN WERE KILLED INSTANTLY, WHILE THE FOURTH COMMITTED SUICIDE.  A PICTURE OF A YOUNG CUBAN GIRL, DATED IN JULY, IS THE ONLY PUBLISHED CLUE AS TO THE IDENTITY OF THE MEN, WHETHER NICARAGUANS, CUBANS, OR SALVADORANS, COMMISSIONED FOR THIS CLANDESTINE MISSION DIRECTED FROM NICARAGUA.  OUR SOURCE SAID THAT YOUNG SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS WERE TRAINED AT THE NATIONAL CIVILIAN FLIGHT SCHOOL OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS.  THE TRAINING WAS SUPERVISED BY CAPTAIN ROBIN ROMERO, THE FLIGHT SCHOOL'S DIRECTOR.  THE TRAINING WAS ALSO CONDUCTED AT PUNTA HUETE AND LOS BRASILES.  MOST OF THE FLIGHTS WERE MADE AT NIGHT. THE STUDENT PILOTS USED OIL LAMPS AS LANDING LIGHTS.  THE SOURCE SAID THE TRAINING FLIGHTS WERE CONDUCTED IN LIGHT SINGLE-ENGINE PLANES FROM SANDINO AIRPORT TO PUNTA HUETE OR LOS BRASILES.     THE HEAD OF THIS OPERATION WAS COMMANDER CHRISTIAN PICHARDO.  IN THE OPERATION ALSO PARTICIPATED TWO SALVADORAN GUERRILLA COMMANDERS WHOSE IDENTITIES ARE UNKNOWN.  THE CESSNA 310 HAD BEEN LEASED BY THE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANK [BND], WHICH IN TURN HAD ACQUIRED THE PLANE FROM THE ZETA NATIONAL CHARTER SERVICE, AN AERONICA SUBSIDIARY.  BND ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR MARCOS BLANDON GRAVY LEASED THE PLANE, ONE OF SEVERAL AIRCRAFT INTENDED TO BE SENT TO EL SALVADOR.  ANOTHER SINGLE-ENGINE CESSNA, WITH REGISTRATION CHARLIE BRAVO PAPA, AND AN AERO COMMANDER, WERE ADDED TO THE INVENTORY.  ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE, THE AERO COMMANDER WAS CONFISCATED FROM COLOMBIAN DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN PUERTO CABEZAS A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY WERE INTERCEPTED BY SANDINIST AIR FORCE [FAS] PLANES.  THE PLANES INVOLVED IN THE OPERATION, HOWEVER, REMAINED UNEQUIPPED TO FLY TO EL SALVADOR UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. [CONTINUED]",

ACCORDING TO CHICA, THE FMLN LEADERS IN MANAGUA DECIDED TO LAUNCH THE OFFENSIVE, TRUSTING THE UNTS LEADERS' REPORTS THAT CONDITIONS WERE RIGHT FOR AN INSURRECTION BECAUSE FEBE ELIZABETH VELAZQUEZ' DEATH IN THE DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION] HAD IGNITED THE PEOPLE'S SPIRITS.  THE PRISONER SAID THAT THE FMLN MAY CARRY OUT A SUMMARY TRIAL IN THE STYLE OF COMMUNIST PARTIES AGAINST THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE.

[GUEVARA] HOW DO THE FIVE PRESIDENTS CONCEIVE THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE FMLN?  HOW DOES THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT CONCEIVE THIS HAPPENING?     [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE THERE HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN THIS PRESIDENTIAL MEETING AS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS MEETINGS.  TO EXPLAIN THIS BETTER, MARCO ANTONIO, WE MUST SAY WE WILL NOT FALL INTO WHAT HAS BEEN USED IN THE PAST, THAT IS, THE FAMOUS SYMMETRY.  ON THIS OCCASION, WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR AND CATEGORICAL WHEN WE SAID THAT WE WERE NOT WILLING TO CONTINUE CONTRIBUTING SACRIFICES AND OTHER THINGS FROM THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE NICARAGUAN PROBLEM EXCLUSIVELY.  WE DEMANDED UNIFORMITY, AND ANY OTHER COUNTRY CONFRONTING THE AGGRESSION OF AN IRREGULAR FORCE -- ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN CENTRAL AMERICA -- ALSO HAS THE RIGHT TO BE TREATED IN A UNIFORM MANNER, AS FAR AS MEASURES AND CRITERIA THAT MAY BE ADOPTED IN THE PRESIDENTIAL MEETINGS.     THAT IS WHY TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE SEEING HOW THE MEASURES ADOPTED FOR THE NICARAGUAN RESISTANCE -- THAT HAD BEEN GRANTED MOST OF THE ATTENTION UP TO NOW -- ARE ALSO BEING ADOPTED FOR THE FMLN.     WE CANNOT ALLOW A COUNTRY TO CLAIM IT IS THE ONLY TARGET OF AN AGGRESSION BY AN IRREGULAR ARMED FORCE SUPPORTED FROM ABROAD.  HERE IN EL SALVADOR WE NOW HAVE GREATER EVIDENCE FOLLOWING THIS 11 NOVEMBER TERRORIST AGGRESSION THAT THE FMLN IS A MOVEMENT THAT CAN SURVIVE ONLY WITH SUPPORT FROM ABROAD, AND THAT IT OBEYS AND EXISTS BECAUSE OF INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENTS.     IN THE SECOND PLACE, IT HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT IT ONLY HAS THE CAPACITY TO GENERATE TERRORISM, WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN THIS DOCUMENT.  WE CANNOT CONTINUE JUST TALKING ABOUT DEMOBILIZATION AND PACIFICATION IN NICARAGUA.  IT IS TIME TO APPLY THIS TO ALL IRREGULAR GROUPS, BE IT THE URNG [GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY] IN GUATEMALA, OR ANY OTHER IRREGULAR ARMED GROUP THAT MAY COME UP AND MAY TRY TO HINDER THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE AREA.     WE SEE THIS AS SOMETHING THAT HAS GONE DEEP INTO THE MINDS OF ALL THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, AND FROM NOW ON, WE WILL HAVE GREATER UNIFORMITY IN TREATING ALL OF THOSE IRREGULAR GROUPS THAT OPERATE IN THE REGION.     [MODERATOR] RENE HURTADO OF EL MUNDO.     [HURTADO] MR PRESIDENT, FOLLOWING THE TELA AND COSTA DEL SOL MEETINGS, NICARAGUA HAS CHANGED ITS STAND.  IN COSTA RICA, PRESIDENT ORTEGA WAS ASKED IF HE HAD SOLD OUT THE FMLN IN EXCHANGE FOR THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS AND OTHER RESULTS OF THE SUMMIT IN FAVOR OF NICARAGUA.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR OPINION ABOUT THIS, AND ALSO HOW YOU INTERPRET THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT ORTEGA HAS ACCEPTED SOME ISSUES ABOUT THE FMLN THAT HE DID NOT ALLOW IN TELA OR COSTA DEL SOL? ON THE OTHER HAND, WILL THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE FMLN BE THE RESULT OF A DIALOGUE OR NEGOTIATIONS LATER ON?     [CRISTIANI] IN THE FIRST PLACE, I BELIEVE THAT DANIEL ORTEGA WAS UNABLE TO PULL ANY MORE TRICKS OUT OF HIS HAT, AND HE WAS FACING A FACT HE COULD NO LONGER HIDE: HE IS THE ONE WHO IS SPREADING ARMED REVOLUTIONS IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND TRYING TO HAMPER DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES IN THE REGION.  ONCE MORE HE HAS BEEN CAUGHT NOT HONORING THE COMMITMENTS AGREED ON IN TELA, BUT RATHER VIOLATING THESE COMMITMENTS.  ON THIS OCCASION HE HAS BEEN LEFT WITH NO POSSIBLE DEFENSE.     THEREFORE, IN OUR OPINION, HE HAS NO OPTION OTHER THAN TO ACCEPT THE REALITY OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CENTRAL AMERICA, OR SEE HIMSELF TOTALLY ISOLATED AMID A PEACE PLAN THAT HAS INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT. THIS SITUATION WOULD CAUSE HIM MANY PROBLEMS AND HEADACHES IN POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC MATTERS.",

LET US SEE FIRST WHY THE MEETING TOOK PLACE.  THE MAIN REASON IS THE VERY COMPLICATED PREDICAMENT IN WHICH OUR OFFENSIVE HAS PLACED CRISTIANI AND THE HIGH COMMAND.  AS YOU WILL REMEMBER, THE GOVERNMENT HAS MET WITH MUCH INTERNATIONAL DISREPUTE AND ISOLATION BECAUSE OF THE BRUTAL ASSASSINATION OF JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE BOMBING OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  LET US RECALL, AS A SIGNIFICANT FACT, THAT THE UNITED NATIONS HAS CONDEMNED THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF ALL IT HAS DONE, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE LATEST ATROCITIES.  ON THAT OCCASION, EL SALVADOR WAS THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT VOTED AGAINST THAT RESOLUTION WHILE 96 COUNTRIES VOTED IN FAVOR.     WE MENTION THIS CASE AS A MOST SIGNIFICANT ONE, BUT THE FACT IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH WORLDWIDE CONDEMNATION THAT THE DICTATORSHIP HAS FOUND ITSELF IN A REALLY DESPERATE SITUATION.  THIS WAS A CAUSE OF CONCERN FOR THE NORTH AMERICANS.     TO WHOM COULD THEY TURN AT A TIME WHEN ALL INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HAD TURNED THEIR BACKS ON CRISTIANI?  THE NORTH AMERICANS HAD TO RESORT TO SOME FORUM THAT WOULD NOT CONDEMN THE GENOCIDAL REGIME AND THAT, ON THE CONTRARY, WOULD PROVIDE SUPPORT IN SPITE OF ALL THE ATROCITIES THE REGIME HAS COMMITTED.     THE MOST SUITABLE IDEA WAS TO PROMOTE AN EMERGENCY MEETING OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, BECAUSE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AS WE ALL KNOW, THE NORTH AMERICANS HAVE HAD THEIR BACKYARD AND MOST OF THESE COUNTRIES SERVE THEIR INTERESTS.     THE MEETING WAS CALLED TO TRY TO PULL CRISTIANI OUT OF INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.     UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS DID SUMMIT TAKE PLACE?  WE HAVE TO SAY FIRST THAT THE PRESIDENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND COSTA RICA, AND PROBABLY OF GUATEMALA, HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT PRIOR TO THE MEETING.  THE SUBJECT OF THE DISCUSSION WAS A DOCUMENT DRAFTED BY ARIAS AND CEREZO.  THIS DOCUMENT EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR CRISTIANI FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. JOSEPH SULLIVAN, A U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL IN CHARGE OF LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS, AS WELL AS OTHER U.S.  STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS, WERE PRESENT AT THE MEETING.  THE COSTA RICAN AMBASSADOR TO NICARAGUA -- A PRO-U.S. MAN WHO INTRODUCED THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS AT THE MEETING -- WAS ALSO PRESENT, CONSPIRING ALL THE TIME.  THE FMLN WAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO ENTER COSTA RICA.     HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE MEETING HAD BEEN FIXED AND IN SPITE OF THE U.S. PRESENCE, THE AGREEMENT TO SUPPORT CRISTIANI WAS ACHIEVED ALMOST AT THE PRICE OF KILLING THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENT.  IT WAS NOT EASY.  THE U.S. WILL TO CONDEMN THE FMLN AND TO BACK CRISTIANI PREVAILED IN THE MIDST OF MUCH BICKERING AND THE INSOLENCE OF THE HONDURAN PRESIDENT.     AS YOU CAN SEE, IT WAS NOT EASY TO FIND SUPPORT FOR THE GENOCIDAL REGIME EVEN IN PLACES WHERE THE NORTH AMERICANS THINK THEY HAVE THE BULL BY THE HORNS.     LET US SEE, AS A THIRD POINT, IN WHAT THE DECLARATION CONSISTS. [CONTINUED]",

MILITARY SPOKESMEN FOR THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE, HEADQUARTERED IN THE EASTERN USULUTAN DEPARTMENT, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT TWO REBELS WERE KILLED AND ONE WOUNDED DURING A CLASH WITH GOVERNMENT TROOPS IN SAN AGUSTIN.     MEANWHILE, THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) REPORTED THAT THE BODIES OF TWO GUERRILLAS, WHO WERE PRESUMABLY KILLED DURING CLASHES WITH THE ARMY, WERE FOUND BY SOLDIERS IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF SANTA TECLA, IN THE CENTRAL LA LIBERTAD DEPARTMENT.     COPREFA REPORTED THAT TWO SOLDIERS WERE KILLED DURING A CLASH WITH MEMBERS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) IN COMASAGUA, ABOUT 28 KM TO THE SOUTHWEST OF [SAN] SALVADOR, WHERE A REBEL ATTACK ON A COFFEE PROCESSING PLANT WAS SUCCESSFULLY REPELLED.     IT REPORTED THAT A CIVILIAN WAS KILLED IN THE CROSSFIRE AND THAT A SOLDIER WAS ALSO KILLED DURING CLASHES IN ZARAGOZA, SOUTH OF SAN SALVADOR, WHERE TWO GUERRILLAS WERE WOUNDED.     THE MILITARY REPORT STATED THAT 10 REBELS WERE WOUNDED IN TECOLUCA, SAN VICENTE DEPARTMENT, ABOUT 60 KM EAST OF THE CAPITAL, DURING AN ARMED CLASH BETWEEN INSURGENTS AND THE 5TH [INFANTRY] BRIGADE, HEADQUARTERED IN THAT DEPARTMENT.     THREE OTHER SOLDIERS WERE WOUNDED DURING AN FMLN AMBUSH IN GUAZAPA, NORTH OF [SAN] SALVADOR, ONE OF THE GUERRILLAS' MAIN BASTIONS.     THE SALVADORAN [AIR] FORCE THIS MORNING BOMBED REBEL POSITIONS IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF JUCUAPA, USULUTAN DEPARTMENT, BUT NO RESULTS ARE YET AVAILABLE, AREA RESIDENTS TOLD ACAN-EFE.     THE FMLN THIS MORNING HARRASSED [ARMY POSITIONS STATIONED NEAR] AYUTUXTEPEQUE, NORTH OF [SAN] SALVADOR, WITHOUT INFLICTING ANY CASUALTIES.     COPREFA ALSO REPORTED THAT THE [ARMED] FORCES SEIZED FROM THE GUERRILLAS 500 ELECTRIC CATAPULTS, IN THE NORTHERN [CHALATENANGO] DEPARTMENT, WHICH THE FMLN HAD USED SINCE LAST YEAR TO ATTACK [SAN] SALVADOR GARRISONS.     SALVADORAN [RED] CROSS SOURCES TODAY REPORTED THAT A 48-YEAR-OLD WOMAN IDENTIFIED AS MARIA LUZ LOPEZ WAS WOUNDED LAST NIGHT WHEN A POWERFUL BOMB, WHICH DAMAGED SEVERAL BUSINESSES IN [SAN] SALVADOR, EXPLODED.     THE BOMB WAS PLANTED IN A HEAVILY COMMERCIAL AREA OF DOWNTOWN [SAN] SALVADOR CAUSING HEAVY PROPERTY LOSES, ACCORDING TO THE OWNERS WHO PROVIDED NO SPECIFIC FIGURES.     THIS IS THE FOURTH DYNAMITE ATTACK ON BUSINESSES IN [SAN] SALVADOR SO FAR IN 1990.     THE GUERRILLAS INTENSIFIED THEIR ACTS OF SABOTAGE AGAINST THE ECONOMY, ESPECIALLY AGAINST THE ENTIRE ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEM, ON 2 JANUARY WHEN AN UNILATERAL MILITARY TRUCE THEY DECREED OVER THE CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR HOLIDAYS HAD EXPIRED.",

I HAVE CALLED THIS NEWS CONFERENCE TO READ A FOREIGN MINISTRY COMMUNIQUE: [WORDS INDISTINCT] TODAY THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT TOLD LUIS SANDIGA CABRERA, OUR CHARGE D'AFFAIRES IN PANAMA, THAT HE MUST LEAVE PANAMA IN 72 HOURS.     2.  WE HAVE EXPRESSED TO THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE PANAMANIAN CHARGE D'AFFAIRES IN LIMA, OUR SURPRISE AND STRONG PROTEST OVER THAT DECISION.     3.  IN VIEW OF THIS DECISION, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO REDUCE THE PERSONNEL OF ITS DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN PANAMA AND TO MAINTAIN ITS RELATIONS WITH THAT COUNTRY AT THE FIRST SECRETARY LEVEL. PERU WILL IN THIS WAY CONTINUE TO FULFILL THE HUMANITARIAN MISSION OF PROTECTING THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT ASYLUM IN ITS EMBASSY IN PANAMA WHILE THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT ISSUES THE SAFE-CONDUCTS THAT WE REQUESTED IN ACCORDANCE TO THE CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM SIGNED IN CARACAS ON 28 MARCH 1954.     PERU IS CONTACTING THE MEMBERS OF THE PERMANENT MECHANISM FOR CONSULTATION AND POLITICAL AGREEMENT [GROUP OF EIGHT] TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION AND TO ASK FOR SOLIDARITY AND COOPERATION IN OVERCOMING THIS MOMENTARY CRISIS.     THE DELICATE SITUATION REGARDING THE PEOPLE AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY HAS PROVOKED OUR JUSTIFIED ALARM AND IMPELLED US TO BEGIN TALKS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM WILL BE RESPECTED.  WE HAVE TALKED WITH THE AMBASSADORS FROM THE COUNTRIES OF THE PERMANENT MECHANISM FOR CONSULTATION AND POLITICAL AGREEMENT.  I HAVE PERSONALLY SPOKEN WITH THE AMBASSADORS OF VENEZUELA, MEXICO, AND COLOMBIA.     I AM NOW READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS:     [REPORTER] MR LARCO COX, UNOFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE SAID THAT THE PEOPLE IN THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA ARE NOT EXACTLY POLITICAL REFUGEES BUT COMMON CRIMINALS.  WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THIS?     [LARCO COX] THE COUNTRY THAT GRANTS ASYLUM DETERMINES THIS.  WE HAVE BEEN VERY CAREFUL TO REVIEW EACH ONE OF THEM AND THEIR FILES.  WE HAVE CHECKED TO SEE IF ANY OF THEM WERE FACING ANY TRIALS IN PANAMA OR THE UNITED STATES.  OUR INVESTIGATION HAS REVEALED THAT NONE OF THEM ARE FACING ANY TRIALS.  THE CHARGES WERE MADE AFTERWARD.  WE SEE THIS AS A RESULT OF THE EMOTIONAL CLIMATE PRESENTLY EXISTING IN PANAMA.     [REPORTER] WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL OPINION OF THE INCIDENT?     [LARCO COX] IT IS THE DIPLOMATIC WAY TO EXPRESS A PROTEST OVER WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE.  ACCORDING TO PANAMANIAN REPORTS, CHARGE D'AFFAIRES LUIS SANDIGA HAS MADE STATEMENTS ON THE SITUATION THAT DID NOT PLEASE THE GOVERNMENT.  THE TRUTH IS THAT SANDIGA HAS NOT MADE ANY DECLARATIONS.  HOWEVER, FORMER AMBASSADOR CASTRO ARENAS IS IN PANAMA AND HE HAS EMBARKED ON A CAMPAIGN IN WHICH HE IS SEEKING RETALIATION AGAINST THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT.  HE COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING BETTER THAN TO POINT AT SANDIGA AS THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLEGED STATEMENTS.  SANDIGA HAS NOT SAID A WORD ABOUT THE SITUATION BECAUSE THAT IS NOT HIS JOB.  BESIDES, HIS CAR AND THE CAR BELONGING TO ONE OF THE EMBASSY'S MILITARY ATTACHES HAVE BEEN STOLEN; THERE IS NO WAY TO BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION.     [REPORTER] ARE YOU SAYING THAT FORMER AMBASSADOR CASTRO ARENAS IS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SITUATION?     [LARCO COX] YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS.     [REPORTER] IF THE SITUATION DETERIORATES, WILL PERU RECALL ALL OF ITS PERSONNEL FROM PANAMA?     [LARCO COX] WE CANNOT GO TO THAT EXTREME BECAUSE WE ARE FULFILLING A HUMANITARIAN CAUSE, AS WE SAID IN THE COMMUNIQUE.  OUR FIRST RESPONSIBILITY AT THIS TIME IS TO SEE THAT THE RIGHT OF ASYLUM IS RESPECTED.  AS LONG AS THE REFUGEES REMAIN IN THE EMBASSY, WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR REPRESENTATION AT THE LEVEL OF FIRST SECRETARY. [END RECORDING]",

PRIOR TO JARAMILLO OSSA'S ARRIVAL AT THE NATIONAL REGISTRY OFFICE, ACCOMPANIED BY 12 BODYGUARDS, EXPLOSIVES EXPERTS FROM THE SECRET POLICE DEPARTMENT CHECKED THE BUILDING AND CORDONED OFF THE ENTRANCE HE WAS GOING TO USE.     UP WAS FOUNDED IN 1985 AND HAS LOST ALMOST 1,000 MEMBERS AND REGIONAL LEADERS IN VIOLENT ATTACKS.  IT HAS ALSO LOST MOST OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES IN BOGOTA, INCLUDING JAIME PARDO LEAL, THE PARTY FOUNDER AND A PREVIOUS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO WAS MURDERED IN 1987.     COLOMBIAN COMMUNIST PARTY PRESIDENT GILBERTO VIEIRA AND THE ENTIRE UP DIRECTORATE ATTENDED BERNARDO JARAMILLO'S REGISTRATION.     LAST WEEK, THE STATE COUNCIL, COLOMBIA'S HIGHEST LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE BODY, HAD ACCREDITED BERNARDO JARAMILLO AS UP'S PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.     BEFORE MAKING HIS CANDIDACY EFFECTIVE, BERNARDO JARAMILLO TOLD EFE THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO BECOME \"THE WILL OF A WIDE AND DEMOCRATIC SECTOR OF THE PEOPLE AND AN ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL COLOMBIAN BIPARTISANSHIP.\"  HE ADDED: \"OUR MOVEMENT WANTS TO TRANSCEND THE LIMITS OF THE UP AND OBTAIN FOLLOWERS FROM OTHER SECTORS OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEFT WHO SUPPORT NEW GOVERNMENT ALTERNATIVES.\"     HE DID NOT REJECT THE POSSIBILITY THAT UP AND THE 19TH APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19), A REBEL MOVEMENT THAT IS MAKING EFFORTS TO JOIN THE COUNTRY'S LEGAL POLITICAL SYSTEM, WILL PRESENT JOINT ELECTORAL TICKETS IN SOME REGIONS IN THE COUNTRY.     \"THERE IS NOTHING CONCRETE ON THIS,\" HE ADDED, \"BUT IT COULD BE AN ALTERNATIVE IF THEY PROPOSE IT.\"     UP PRESIDENT DIEGO MONTANA STATED THAT \"OUR PARTY'S MAIN OBJECTIVE IN THESE ELECTIONS IS TO BREAK THE LIBERAL AND SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE HEGEMONY.\"  THESE TWO SECTORS HAVE SHARED POWER DURING COLOMBIA'S ENTIRE REPUBLICAN PERIOD.     \"WE PRESENT OUR CANDIDATE TO OTHER POLITICAL MOVEMENTS WITH THE HOPE THAT HIS CANDIDACY WILL BE BACKED AND THAT WE CAN CREATE A NEW AND WIDER FORCE WITH POSSIBILITIES OF ATTAINING VICTORY,\" HE NOTED.     JARAMILLO'S CAMPAIGN SLOGAN, \"COUNTRYMEN, GIVE ME YOUR HAND\" APPEARED IN POSTERS THROUGHOUT BOGOTA TODAY.     AFTER REGISTERING, BERNARDO JARAMILLO ATTENDED THE FUNERAL OF A FELLOW PARTY MEMBER, VLADIMIR ESCOBAR, A SOACHA MUNICIPAL OFFICIAL WHO WAS SHOT BETWEEN THE EYES AND KILLED THIS WEEK.

WE HAVE VIEWED WITH GREAT CONCERN THE GOVERNMENT AND ARMY'S REJECTION MR PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S PARTICIPATION IN THE DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION PROCESS AS A MEDIATOR.  THIS ATTITUDE IS AN OBSTACLE TO A PROCESS THAT COULD FACILITATE THE NEGOTIATION EFFORT.  ON OUR PART, WE HAVE ACCEPTED THIS MEDIATION AND WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE IT.     2. THE STATE OF SIEGE, THE ASSASSINATION OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER HECTOR OQUELI, THE DOUBTFUL AND INSUFFICIENT INITIAL RESULTS IN THE CASE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE ABSENCE OF CONDITIONS FOR THE POLITICAL ACTIVITY OF THE OPPOSITION, THE CONTINUATION OF THE PERSECUTION OF CHURCHES, AND THE LACK OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH THROUGH THE DIRECT OR COVERT GAGGING OF THE PRESS SHOW THAT CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT IS CARRYING OUT A POLICY OF CONFRONTATION WITH ALL THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FORCES.  FOR THIS REASON, THE TERMS OF THE DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION MUST BE REORIENTED SO THAT IT WILL BE TURNED INTO A NATIONAL PROCESS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL THOSE FORCES.     3. WE VIEW AS GRAVELY ERRONEOUS THE PERSISTENCE OF A GOVERNMENT POLICY BASED ON THE IDEA OF THE FMLN'S ALLEGED MILITARY WEAKNESS.  THIS POSITION, SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT WAS PUT FORTH PRIOR TO 11 NOVEMBER [DATE OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FMLN MILITARY OFFENSIVE] WILL ONLY LEAD THE COUNTRY TO GREATER LEVELS OF CONFRONTATION.     4. WE REAFFIRM OUR WILLINGNESS TO HOLD THE MEETING OF BOTH SIDES WITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL SOON.  WE HOPE THAT MR CRISTIANI'S VISIT TO THE UNITED NATIONS WILL LEAD TO SUCH A MEETING AND THAT WE CAN AGREE WITH THE MEDIATOR ON THE DATE TO HOLD IT.     5.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE U.S. AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS DIRECTED AGAINST DEMOCRATIZATION AND A POLITICAL SOLUTION.  THE SENDING OF SIGNALS TO ONE OR ANOTHER SECTOR OF THE GOVERNMENT OR ARMY, USING THE PRESSURE OF SETTING CONDITIONS OR THREATENING THE END OF AID, DOES NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.  WE BELIEVE THE MEMBERS OF THE U.S. CONGRESS CAN MAKE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO END THE WAR IN OUR COUNTRY BY AGREEING TO SUSPEND THAT AID, SOMETHING WHICH COULD FORM PART OF A NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT THAT WOULD SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTAIL A CEASE-FIRE.

THIS IS, HOWEVER, A CRITICAL MOMENT FOR THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT, AND HE KNOWS IT.  BUT THIS POINT WAS ALSO STRESSED BY THE LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO BOOED HIM AT NEARLY EVERY LARGE U.S.  CITY HE VISITED.  ALTHOUGH THE GHOSTS OF THE ASSASSINATED JESUITS SHADOWED HIM ALL DURING HIS TOUR, THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] REPRESENTATIVE, JUST AS HIS PREDECESSOR JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE DID, FLEW TO THE UNITED STATES TO TRY TO CONVINCE THE LEGISLATORS, PARTICULARLY THE DEMOCRATS, THAT HE INTENDS TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE FOR PEACE AND CHECK THE ARMY'S CRIMINAL ASPIRATIONS.  WAVING THE HUMAN RIGHTS FLAG HAS BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR CRISTIANI, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE HE IS AWARE THAT WITH THIS ACTION HE CAN CONTINUE TO RECEIVE WASHINGTON'S FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR HIS GOVERNMENT.     ACCORDING TO TO SOME EXPERTS, CRISTIANI WENT FARTHER THAN HIS PREDECESSOR.  HE ASKED THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO HELP IN THE RESUMPTION OF TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS, REPLACED SEVERAL MILITARY OFFICERS OF DOUBTFUL REPUTATION, AND ASSURED HE WILL PUNISH SEVERELY EIGHT SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF ASSASSINATING THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS.  WE MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT, PRIOR TO HIS TRIP, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT SUCCEEDED IN CURBING A COUP ATTEMPT STAGED BY ARMY REACTIONARY GROUPS. MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN OPPOSITION HAVE COINCIDED IN THER VIEW THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD A HEAD OF STATE CHALLENGED THE MILITARY HIERARCHY TO SUCH AN EXTENT, A HIERARCHY THAT OPPOSES ALL NEGOTIATION WITH THE GUERRILLAS.  THE EXPERTS ALSO SAID, HOWEVER, THAT THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL SITUATION HAS NEVER BEEN SO SERIOUS.     THE REBEL OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED IN NOVEMBER IS A LANDMARK, AFTER WHICH EVERYTHING WILL BE DIFFERENT IN EL SALVADOR, BEGINNING WITH THE GOVERNMENT PARTY, WHICH WAS LEFT IN A VERY DELICATE SITUATION IN THE EYES OF INFLUENTIAL U.S. POWER CIRCLES.  THE GUERRILLA DRIVE ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT ONLY TWO ALTERNATIVES ARE LEFT FOR THE COUNTRY.  IF SERIOUS PEACE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOT INITIATED, THE COUNTERINSURGENCY POLICY WILL BE AGGRAVATED. THIS COULD EVEN GIVE THE UNITED STATES A PRETEXT TO INTERVENE DIRECTLY IN THE COUNTRY.     ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH SAID HE WOULD CONTINUE TO AID EL SALVADOR, A LARGE NUMBER OF LEGISLATORS FOR A LONG TIME HAVE BEEN QUESTIONING WHAT USE HAS BEEN NEARLY $4 BILLION DELIVERED TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY IN 10 YEARS OF WAR.  IF FOR THE WHITE HOUSE THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO CONTINUE TO GIVE MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR OR RESIGN ITSELF TO AN EVENTUAL VICTORY OF THE REBELS, FOR CRISTIANI THE SITUATION IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE, TO GET MORE MONEY, HE MUST ENSURE THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED.  THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO INFLUENCING THE MOST REACTIONARY MILITARY OFFICERS AND GUARANTEEING THE FULFILLMENT OF THE FAMOUS ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN ADVOCATED BY HIS PARTY.  THESE POINTS ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLY WITH IN A COUNTRY IMMERSED IN WAR.  IF THE ECONOMY IS WEAK, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IS EVEN WEAKER.  ANYWAY, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING TO INCREASE AID FOR THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  THIS CONTRIBUTES TO PUTTING FAR INTO THE DISTANCE ANY PLANS TO END THE WAR.",

THIS PAST JANUARY, THE 29-YEAR-OLD GALEANO BECAME THE LEADER OF ABOUT 12,000 NICARAGUAN RIGHTIST REBELS BASED IN HONDURAS WHEN THE POST OF COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE RN ARMY, A POST ENRIQUE BERMUDEZ HAD HELD FOR 10 YEARS, WAS ELIMINATED.     NICARAGUA WILL HOLD ELECTIONS ON SUNDAY, 25 FEBRUARY, AND THE MAIN CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ARE DANIEL ORTEGA OF THE SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FSLN) AND VIOLETA DE CHAMORRO OF THE UNO.     THE REBELS, SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED STATES, HAVE URGED NICARAGUANS TO VOTE FOR THE UNO CANDIDATE.     \"IF THE UNO WINS, WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR ORGANIZATION INTACT TO SEE IF ON 25 APRIL THERE IS A TOTAL TRANSFER OF POWER AND PROFOUND REFORMS, AND PARTICULARLY TO SEE IF THE REPRESSIVE SYSTEM DISAPPEARS,\" GALEANO SAID.     \"IF THE SANDINISTS WIN OR STEAL THE ELECTIONS, THERE WILL BE A SOCIAL DISRUPTION AGAINST THE SYSTEM AND THE HARDEST STRUGGLE OF RECENT YEARS WILL TAKE PLACE,\" HE ADDED.     THE CONTRA MILITARY CHIEF SAID THAT \"IF THE PEOPLE DO NOT ACCEPT A SANDINIST VICTORY, \"WE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE FIGHTING.\"     HE ASSURED THAT THE NICARAGUANS WILL NOT ACCEPT AN FSLN VICTORY IN THE 25 FEBRUARY ELECTIONS.     GALEANO ADDED THAT THE SANDINISTS HAVE DEPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 30,000 TROOPS IN THE NORTHERN NICARAGUAN DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER TO \"INTIMIDATE AND MURDER\" UNO FOLLOWERS AND TO PREVENT APPROXIMATELY 300,000 NICARAGUANS FROM VOTING.     GALEANO POINTED OUT THAT THE PRESS AND THE FOREIGN OBSERVERS OF THE ELECTIONS HAVE NO ACCESS TO THE AREAS WHERE THE NICARAGUAN TROOPS HAVE DEPLOYED.     \"EVEN THOUGH THE FOREIGN OBSERVERS CLAIM THAT THE CAMPAIGN WAS FREELY HELD, THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO MAKE SACRIFICES,\" HE SAID.     GALEANO SAID THAT ABOUT 5,000 OF HIS MEN ARE INSIDE NICARAGUA, AND BETWEEN 10,000 TO 12,000 MEN ARE IN BASES IN HONDURAS, \"NOT MOVING, BUT JUST OBSERVING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS\" IN NICARAGUA.     THE REBELS IN HONDURAS ARE RECEIVING U.S. HUMANITARIAN AID IN EL PARAISO DEPARTMENT AND HAVE REJECTED A DEMOBILIZATION PLAN APPROVED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS.  THE REBELS CLAIM THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY GUARANTEES FOR THEIR PERSONAL SECURITY AND FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.     \"THE DEMOBILIZATION IS BASED ON THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CREATING CONDITIONS THAT WILL ENCOURAGE THE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED RN TO JOIN CIVIC LIFE,\" HE ADDED.     GALEANO SAID THAT THE DISMANTLING OF HIS FORCES DOES NOT \"DEPEND OF A SIMPLE ELECTIONS,\" BUT RATHER ON \"THE SANDINISTS LEAVING POWER COMPLETELY.\"     THE CONTRA LEADER WARNED THAT \"WE CANNOT LAY DOWN OUR WEAPONS WHEN THE CAUSES THAT LED TO OUR TAKING UP ARMS HAVE NOT DISAPPEARED.  THERE STILL IS REPRESSION, A LACK OF FREEDOM, AND ALL OF THIS WAS GENERATED BY THE SANDINISTS.\"     HE POINTED OUT THAT IN THE EVENT THE UNO SHOULD WIN THE 25 FEBRUARY ELECTIONS, \"WE WOULD HAVE TO CARRY OUT A MUTUAL DEMOBILIZATION.  THE NICARAGUAN PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED WITH AN INTER-AMERICAN PEACE FORCE THAT WILL RECEIVE ALL THE WEAPONRY AND SOVIET TANKS OF THE SANDINISTS. THEN, WHEN WE ARE AT AN EVEN LEVEL OF FORCES, WE WILL TURN OVER OUR OWN WEAPONS.\"     THE CONTRA CHIEF SUGGESTED A NATIONAL POLICE BE CREATED IN NICARAGUA.     FRANKLIN SAID THAT THE CONTRAS ARE WILLING TO CONTINUE THE PEACE TALKS, BUT PERHAPS AFTER THE ELECTIONS, WITH THE NEW NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT.     HE ASSURED THAT THE REBEL FORCES WILL NOT CARRY OUT \"ANY OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS BEFORE, DURING, OR AFTER THE ELECTIONS, AND WILL WAIT AND SEE IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN NICARAGUA.\"     HE SAID THAT THE CONTRAS ARE WILLING TO LEAVE THEIR CAMPS IN YAMALES IF REQUESTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF RAFAEL LEONARDO CALLEJAS.     \"IF POLITICAL CONDITIONS DO NOT ALLOW US TO REMAIN, WE WILL LEAVE (FOR NICARAGUA), BUT OUR REFUGEEES WILL STAY, AS REFUGEES,\" HE ADDED.     THE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE CONTRAS SAID THAT HIS FORCES WILL NOT ATTACK THE UN PEACE OBSERVERS IN THE HONDURAN-NICARAGUAN BORDER AREA.     HE SAID THAT RN RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES ARE NORMAL, BUT DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE OUSTING OF BERMUDEZ, ARGUING THAT THIS IS A FAIT ACCOMPLI.",

THE GUERRILLA ACTIONS BEGAN ON THE EVENING OF 22 FEBRUARY WHEN A LARGE COLUMN OF THE POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY [ELN] ENTERED TURBO MUNICIPALITY, NORTHEAST OF ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, AND SABOTAGED THE POWER SYSTEM LEAVING THE ENTIRE AREA WITHOUT ELECTRICITY.  NATIONAL ARMY SPOKESMEN SAID THAT ONE NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER AND SIX SOLDIERS WERE KILLED, FOUR WERE WOUNDED, AND 15 OTHERS WERE KIDNAPPED DURING THE ATTACKS AGAINST MILITARY BASES AND POLICE INSTALLATIONS IN SEGOVIA BY THE 4TH FRONT OF THE FARC [REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES OF COLOMBIA].     MEANWHILE IN BOGOTA, MILITARY FORCES COMMANDER NELSON MEJIA HENAO DENIED THAT COLOMBIA IS IN GUERRILLA HANDS AND REAFFIRMED THE TROOPS' UNYIELDING DETERMINATION TO DEFEND NATIONAL ORDER AND DEMOCRACY.  THE HIGHEST-RANKING OFFICER, WHO EXPRESSED REGRET OVER THE DEATHS OF THE SOLDIERS IN SEGOVIA, ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT, SAID THAT THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT IS NORMAL WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE WAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS WAGING AGAINST ARMED SUBVERSION.     LAST NIGHT, PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS, AFTER THE CLOSING CEREMONY OF THE 25TH AGRARIAN CONGRESS OF THE (FAC) [EXPANSION UNKNOWN], SAID THAT THE GUERRILLAS ARE DESPERATE AND THIS IS REFLECTED IN THEIR ACTIONS.  NEVERTHELESS, THE ARMED FORCES WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT SUBVERSION ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY, HE ADDED.  THE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION AT THE RELEASE OF SANTANDER DEPARTMENT SENATOR JORGE SERRANO GONZALEZ, WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAT COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY HAS AT THIS MOMENT.

WE BELIEVE IT CONSTITUTES THE MOST EXPEDIENT WAY TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN THE COUNTRY, AND WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE ALONG THAT PATH.     [MODERATOR] AIDA MONTALVO.     [MONTALVO] IN REGARD TO THE RENEGOTIATION OF THE FOREIGN DEBT, WHEN ARE YOU PLANNING TO GO TO MEXICO, AND HOW WILL THE SALVADORAN DEBT WITH THAT COUNTRY BE RENEGOTIATED?     [CRISTIANI] THE TIMETABLE FOR THE TRIP IS STILL UNDECIDED.  THERE IS NOT DEFINITE DATE.  I THINK IT MAY TAKE PLACE IN APRIL OR MAY OF THIS YEAR.  OUR FIRST SCHEDULED VISIT WILL BE TO VENEZUELA.     [MODERATOR] CARLOS MARIO MARQUEZ OF AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE.     [MARQUEZ] [WORDS INDISTINCT] SOCIAL ASPECTS.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE STATUS IS OF THAT, SINCE SOME SUPPORT HAVING PRIMARY MEETINGS AND THEN A SUMMIT, SO TO SPEAK?     [CRISTIANI] I DO NOT THINK THAT IS THE CAUSE OF THAT PROBLEM.  WE SAID THAT THE RESUMPTION OF THE TALKS MUST TAKE PLACE WHEN THE FMLN ENTERS THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WITH A SERIOUS ATTITUDE.  WE MAINTAIN OUR STANCE THAT THEY MUST STOP ALL VIOLENCE THAT IS DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY AFFECTING CIVILIANS, THAT IS, ALL THE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES THE FMLN CONDUCTS.  THIS IS A SMALL REQUEST THAT OBTAINED THE SUPPORT OF ALL THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AT THE SAN ISIDRO CORONADO MEETING IN COSTA RICA.     I THINK THAT THIS IS THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.  THEY HAVE ASKED FOR CHANGES IN FORMAT, AND WE SAID WE HAD NO PROBLEM WITH MOST OF THE REQUESTS WE HAVE RECEIVED.  WE ARE NOW WAITING FOR THE FMLN, SINCE THEY ASKED FOR TIME TO ANALYZE THINGS A LITTLE BEFORE HAVING THE MEETING.  WE ARE AWAITING THE VISIT OF MR. DE SOTO IN EARLY MARCH. OBVIOUSLY, THE DIALOGUE HAS NOT TAKEN PLACE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES, [WORDS INDISTINCT].  I THINK THE CHIEF DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT WANT TO AGREE TO STOP TERRORIST ACTIONS, AND THAT IS WHY THERE IS NO DIALOGUE NOW.     [MODERATOR] EPIGMENIO IBARRA.     [IBARRA] MR. PRESIDENT, YESTERDAY IN NICARAGUA, DANIEL ORTEGA SAID AT A RALLY THAT HE WILL WAGE A CONSTRUCTIVE OPPOSITION.  HE SAID THAT THE REVOLUTION DID NOT DIE WITH THE ELECTIONS.  HE SAID THAT THE SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FSLN] WILL RULE FROM BELOW.  WE SENSE A PRETTY COMPLEX CLIMATE FOR THE TRANSITION IN NICARAGUA.  WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT DANIEL ORTEGA'S STATEMENTS?  HOW DO YOU VIEW THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE MAY BE A TRUE TRANSITION FROM POWER TO POWER INSTEAD OF A TRANSITION OF GOVERNMENT IN NICARAGUA?     [CRISTIANI] AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE, STATEMENTS BY ORTEGA AND OTHER REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SANDINIST FRONT ARE A SOURCE OF CONCERN.  THEY COULD INDICATE THAT THE ELECTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN VERY FREE AND HONEST, BUT ALSO A FARCE AS FAR AS IMPROVING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IS CONCERNED.  THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE WOULD BE DENIED THE RIGHT TO FREELY PICK THEIR RULERS AND THE RIGHT OF THESE RULERS TO ACT AS THEY DEEM BEST.  I WOULD SAY THAT THE NICARAGUAN REVOLUTION BELONGS NOT JUST TO THE FSLN.  THE FSLN WAS ONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE REVOLUTION IN NICARAGUA AGAINST ANASTASIO SOMOZA.  THE FACT IS THAT A CONSENSUS EXISTED AMONG ALL SECTORS THAT SUPPORTED THAT REVOLUTION.  THE FSLN HAS NO MONOPOLY ON OR EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OVER THAT REVOLUTION.     I BELIEVE THAT IN IDEOLOGICAL TERMS THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VIEWS OF MS. CHAMORRO AND UNO [NATIONAL OPPOSITION UNION], THAT IS, THE NEW GOVERNMENT-ELECT, AND THE VIEWS OF THE FSLN.  YET, THE PEOPLE PICKED THE GOVERNMENT.  IT IS WORRISOME TO HEAR SOME STATEMENTS THAT THE FSLN WILL RULE FROM BELOW.  WE BELIEVE THEY WOULD SEEK TO DO THAT BY KEEPING CONTROL OVER THE ARMY.  LET ME REPEAT: THERE IS NOTHING DEMOCRATIC ABOUT A POLITICAL PARTY CONTROLLING THE ARMY.  THE ARMY MUST RESPOND TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, AND NOT TO JUST ONE POLITICAL PARTY.  WE BELIEVE THINGS HAVE NOT BEEN SETTLED YET.  WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE STILL MANY THINGS LEFT PENDING.  [CONTINUED]",

ACCORDING TO THE OBSERVERS, THIS CLARIFICATION CAME IN REPLY TO STATEMENTS MADE BY CEREZO THAT THE U.S. POSITION IN THIS REGARD DIFFERS FROM THAT OF MOST COUNTRIES WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY:     [BEGIN RECORDING] [CEREZO] ALL THESE ACTIONS [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE UNITED STATES POINTING THE FINGER TO HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES ARE AIMED AT [WORD INDISTINCT] IN GENEVA, BECAUSE I HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT WHAT IT WANTS AT THIS TIME IS TO HAVE GUATEMALA CONDEMNED AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT TARNISH OUR INTERNATIONAL IMAGE, BECAUSE THE SUCCESS OF THE ESQUIPULAS II PLAN GAVE GUATEMALA, AS AN AUTONOMOUS AND INDEPENDENT COUNTRY, A LOT OF ROOM FOR ACTION.     THAT IS WHAT IT WANTS TO DO, BECAUSE IT IS NOT GOOD FOR LARGE COUNTRIES TO SEE COUNTRIES LIKE GUATEMALA, WITH A CERTAIN DEGREE OF AUTONOMY AND INDEPENDENCE, ACHIEVE HISTORIC SUCCESSES BY SHOWING THAT OUR COUNTRY IS RIGHT IN DISCUSSIONS WITH CERTAIN U.S. GROUPS.  THEY NOW WANT [WORDS INDISTINCT].  MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT THEY NOW SORT OF WANT TO GET BACK AT US FOR THE ESQUIPULAS II PLAN.  [END RECORDING]     IN REPLY TO THESE STATEMENTS BY PRESIDENT CEREZO, THE U.S. EMBASSY POINTED OUT IN ITS COMMUNIQUE OF 6 MARCH THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAD SUPPORTED THE ESQUIPULAS II PEACE PROCESS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.  IT ADDED THAT EVER SINCE THE SIGNING OF THE ESQUIPULAS ACCORD, GUATEMALA HAS RECEIVED $600 MILLION IN U.S. AID.  THIS SHOWS, ACCORDING TO THE EMBASSY, THAT U.S. SUPPORT FOR GUATEMALAN DEMOCRACY CONTINUED TO BE STRONG AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE ESQUIPULAS II DOCUMENT.     IN ANY CASE, FROM PRESIDENT CEREZO'S PERSPECTIVE THE U.S.  ATTITUDE IN THIS SITUATION REFLECTS THE TRADITIONAL INCLINATION OF THAT COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT HISTORY TO DICTATE RULES TO OTHER NATIONS REGARDING WHAT THEY SHOULD DO.  CEREZO COMPARED GUATEMALA'S SITUATION IN MATTERS OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TO THE SITUATION IN SEVERAL U.S. CITIES WHERE THE POLICE ARE UNABLE TO CONTROL CRIME.  AS AN EXAMPLE, HE CITED WASHINGTON, D.C., WHERE ASSAULTS, MURDERS, AND CRIMES FREQUENTLY RELATED TO DRUG CONSUMPTION HAVE REACHED VERY ASTONISHING LEVELS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.     AS FOR THE DEPARTURE OF AMBASSADOR STROOK, CEREZO SAID THAT THE DIPLOMAT HAS NOT BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM GUATEMALA, BUT RETURNED TO THE UNITED STATES FOR CONSULTATIONS BY ORDER OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT.  IN STATEMENTS MADE MINUTES AFTER RECEIVING THE CREDENTIALS OF THE NEW FRG AMBASSADOR, HOWEVER, CEREZO SAID THAT HIS RETURN WAS, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, DUE TO A DECISION WE MADE.",

JULIO E. LINARES ASSERTED WHEN REFERRING TO FORMER COLLABORATORS OF FORMER GENERAL NORIEGA WHO SOUGHT SHELTER IN THESE EMBASSIES SEVERAL WEEKS AGO.     THE MEXICAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA CITY HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS GRANTED DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM TO RAFAEL AROSEMENA, FORMER MANAGER OF THE NATIONAL BANK OF PANAMA.  HOWEVER, THE PANAMANIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THEY WOULD NOT GRANT HIM A SAFECONDUCT TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY, AND THEY SENT A NOTE TO THE MEXICAN EMBASSY URGING IT TO DESIST FROM OFFERING HIM PROTECTION.     ACCORDING TO THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE, RAFAEL AROSEMENA IS INVOLVED IN AUTHORIZING THE PAYMENT OF CHECKS FOR $12 MILLION, MADE OUT TO CASH BY FORMER COLONEL MARCOS JUSTINES.  MEANWHILE, HERACLIDES SUCRE AND GONZALO GONZALEZ, FORMER MAJORS IN THE NOW DEFUNCT DEFENSE FORCES, HAVE SOUGHT ASYLUM AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA CITY. THEY ARE ACCUSED OF KILLING MAJOR MOISES GIROLDI, WHO LED THE FOILED COUP D'ETAT AGAINST NORIEGA IN OCTOBER 1989.     \"WE ARE WILLING TO PAY WHATEVER PRICE IS NECESSARY TO ENFORCE THE LAW, BECAUSE THESE POLITICAL REFUGEES ARE COMMON CRIMINALS AND THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO THAT BENEFIT,\" LINARES STATED WHEN ASKED BY CRITICA LIBRE IF PANAMA WOULD BE WILLING TO STOP THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOUGHT ASYLUM AT THE MEXICAN AND PERUVIAN EMBASSIES FROM LEAVING THE COUNTRY WITHOUT FACING A TRIAL FOR THE CRIMES THEY REPORTEDLY PERPETRATED DURING THE PREVIOUS REGIME.     LINARES SAID THAT PANAMA WILL MAINTAIN ITS POSITION OF NOT GRANTING SAFE-CONDUCTS TO THESE REFUGEES, EVEN IF THE MEXICAN AND PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT INSIST ON GRANTING THEM DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM, AND ADMITTED THAT THIS WILL LIKELY CREATE AN INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT.     NEVERTHELESS, LINARES SAID THAT HE HOPES THERE WILL BE NO NEED TO BREAK DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH EITHER OF THESE COUNTRIES, WHICH INSIST ON KEEPING FORMER COLLABORATORS OF FORMER GEN NORIEGA AS REFUGEES, AND HE EMPHASIZED THE NEED TO REACH AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THESE NATIONS.     \"WE HOPE THAT RELATIONS WITH MEXICO WILL NOT COOL OFF OR REACH A BREAKING POINT GIVEN THE AFFECTION THAT UNITES US AS FREE NATIONS,\" LINARES ADDED.     HE REVEALED THAT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY SENT A NOTE TO THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT STATING THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO GIVE DIPLOMATI PROTECTION TO THE REFUGEES IN ITS EMBASSY, BECAUSE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WERE STARTED AGAINST THEM AFTER THEY HAD BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE DIPLOMATIC MISSION.     \"WE ARE PREPARING A NOTE OF REPLY TO THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT,\" FOREIGN MINISTER LINARES SAID.     THE FOLLOWING PERSONS ARE STILL REFUGEES AT THE ECUADORAN EMBASSY: FORMER PUBLIC WORKS MINISTER RENE BULTRON, FORMER LABOR MINISTER CESAR MARTANS, FORMER NATIONAL MORTGAGE BANK MANAGER JULIO SHAIK, FORMER IRHE [INSTITUTE OF HYDRAULIC RESOURCES AND ELECTRIFICATION] DIRECTOR LEOVIGILDO HERRRERA, AND FORMER TOURISM DIRECTOR BERNARDO DOMINGUEZ.     LAST WEEK THE FOREIGN MINISTER REVIEWED THE POSSIBILITY OF GRANTING SAFE-CONDUCTS TO FIVE OF THESE FORMER OFFICIALS IN THE PREVIOUS REGIME, PROVIDED THERE IS NO CASE PENDING AGAINST THEM.

THE COMMUNIQUE HAS BEEN SIGNED BY ALL THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES OF THE COUNTRY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE LIBERAL PARTY.  THE COMMUNIQUE ASKS THE GOVERNMENT TO OFFER FULL GUARANTEES DURING THE ELECTIONS PROCESS AND TO POSTPONE THE ELECTIONS.  THE FOLLOWING IS THE COMMUNIQUE THAT HAS BEEN ISSUED IN THE ELIPTICO ROOM OF THE NATIONAL CAPITOL:     [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] WE REPORT TO THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD THE FOLLOWING:     1. WE ONCE AGAIN CONDEMN THE VILE MURDER OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DR. BERNARDO JARAMILLO.  THIS MURDER HAS MADE EVIDENT THE LACK OF GUARANTEES IN THE COUNTRY, GUARANTEES THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS SYSTEMATICALLY DENIED THE OPPOSITION PARTIES.  WE REJECT THE MANIPULATIONS IN WHICH OFFICIAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE ENGAGED IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTIGATING THIS CRIME.     2. WE DENOUNCE THAT THE OFFICIAL APPARATUS IS AT THE SERVICE OF ONLY ONE CANDIDATE AND THAT IT IS PREPARED TO ESTABLISH PARTY PREDOMINANCE THAT WOULD IN PRACTICE BE A REJECTION OF DEMOCRATIC PLURALISM.     3. WE DEMAND FULL GUARANTEES FOR ALL THE FORCES PARTICIPATING IN THE ELECTIONS AND EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THE STATE MEDIA SO THAT THESE FORCES CAN MAKE KNOWN THEIR POLITICAL POSITIONS.     4. WE REQUEST GUARANTEES THAT THE NEW ELECTORAL SYSTEM WILL NOT HAVE THE SAME DIFFICULTIES THAT EXISTED DURING THE 11 MARCH ELECTIONS, THE RESULTS OF WHICH ARE STILL UNKNOWN.     5. UNDER THE CURRENT CONDITIONS, WE ASK OUR REPRESENTATIVES IN THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL TO ABSTAIN FROM PARTICIPATING IN DISCUSSIONS AND DECISIONS OF THAT COUNCIL.     6. IN VIEW OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE HAVE AGREED TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND OUR ELECTION CAMPAIGNS AND DEMAND A POSTPONEMENT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 27 MAY.     7. WE INSIST THAT THE RATIFICATION OF CARLOS LEMOS SIMMONDS IN THE GOVERNMENT MINISTRY REPRESENTS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION TO FINDING AN INSTITUTIONAL INTERLOCUTOR IN NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.     8. WE ANNOUNCE THE IMMEDIATE PRESENCE OF INTERNATIONAL [WORDS INDISTINCT] TO VERIFY THAT THE ELECTORAL GUARANTEES WE ARE DEMANDING ARE GRANTED AND TO OBSERVE THE ELECTIONS PROCESS.     9. THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE OF THE OPPOSITION HEREBY STATES ITS DECISION TO WORK FOR THE FORMATION OF A CONSTITUENT NATIONAL ASSEMBLY THAT MUST HAVE A DEMOCRATIC AND PLURALISTIC COMPOSITION WITH THE DECIDING PARTICIPATION OF THE NATIONAL [WORD INDISTINCT] TO APPROVE A NEW CONSTITUTION AND TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD FINDING POLITICAL SOLUTIONS TO THE SOCIAL CONFLICT OF COLOMBIA.  WE APPEAL TO THE LEADERS OF THE COUNTRY TO URGE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO DEFEND AND RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS.     10. WE REITERATE OUR POSITION THAT THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THE ARMED CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY IS A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION.     11. WE URGE THE LIBERAL PARTY TO POSTPONE ITS NATIONAL CONVENTION IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE PATRIOTIC UNION AND THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE.     12. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S CALL AND WE WILL PROMOTE THIS CALL THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE.     13. IN DEFENSE OF A PLURALISTIC DEMOCRACY WE WILL MAINTAIN THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE OF THE OPPOSITION WE HAVE CREATED.  WE HEREBY ASK OUR FOLLOWERS AND ALL OUR COUNTRYMEN TO REMAIN ON A STATE OF ALERT.     THIS COMMITTEE WILL HOLD A NEW MEETING TUESDAY 27 MARCH, AT 1500, IN THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES.  WE URGE ALL POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES INTERESTED IN THESE OBJECTIVES TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THIS MEETING.     RESOLUTION;     DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM, THE POPULAR MOVEMENT [WORDS INDISTINCT], THE BROAD FRONT [WORDS INDISTINCT], THE NATIONALIST ACTION FOR PEACE, AND THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT [M-19] WANT TO LEAVE ON RECORD THE FOLLOWING:     THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS BETWEEN THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND M-19 THAT BEGAN ON 10 JANUARY 1989 AND THAT PRODUCED ON 9 MARCH 1990 A PEACE AGREEMENT WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE MURDER OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO, BUT WILL NOT RESULT IN AN END TO THE SEARCH FOR PEACE BY THE TWO PARTIES.     WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE ARMED CONFLICT IN COLOMBIA.  [END RECORDING]",

ALSO, THE FMLN-FDR CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK ON GENERAL RAFAEL HUMBERTO LARIOS'S SON-IN-LAW, ACCUSING HIM OF BEING A MILITARY PILOT -- WHEN IN FACT HE HAS BEEN A CIVILIAN PILOT AND HE WAS WORKING IN A SMALL AUTOMOBILE SPARE PARTS DISTRIBUTION COMPANY AT THE TIME OF THE ATTACK.

CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ.  THE MESSAGE READS AS FOLLOWS:     CARLOS PIZARRO'S MURDER IS A MONSTROUS CRIME THAT HAS CUT SHORT THE LIFE OF A MAN WHO HAD SHOWN HIS WILL FOR PEACE AND HIS COMMITMENT TO COLOMBIA.  THE CRIME WAS DIRECTED AT HINDERING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND DESTROYING THE RECONCILIATION PROCESS THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED, SURPASSING MANY OBSTACLES.  IN THIS CASE, AS IN MANY OTHERS, THIS PAINFUL TRAGEDY SHOULD SERVE TO CONSOLIDATE THE IDEALS OF PEACE AND PLURALISM FOR WHICH SO MANY COLOMBIANS HAVE STRUGGLED -- ONE OF THEM, CARLOS PIZARRO.  IT SHOULD SERVE TO REASSERT OUR REPUDIATION OF VIOLENCE AND OUR FAITH IN DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES.     FURTHER ON THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE NOTES:     PIZARRO'S RELATIVES AND HIS FOLLOWERS KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT, AND I PERSONALLY, FEEL STRONG WRATH AND SADNESS, BUT WE WILL NOT BE DISCOURAGED.  WE WILL UPHOLD THE BANNERS OF RECONCILIATION, PLURALISM, AND THE RIGHT TO FREELY AND PEACEFULLY EXPRESS ANY IDEA.  WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO UNMASK AND COMBAT ENEMIES OF PEACE.     THE PRESIDENT ADDS IN HIS MESSAGE:     I INTERPRET THE DESIRE OF ALL COLOMBIANS WHO ADMIRED CARLOS PIZARRO'S DEMOCRATIC VOCATION, BY WARNING THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS TRAGIC MURDER THAT THEY WILL NOT MANAGE TO DESTROY WHAT HAS BEEN WORKED FOR SO HARD AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF POLITICAL FORCES AND THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR PEACE ON 11 MARCH TO OPEN A ROAD FOR PEACE THAT IS CLEAR, POSSIBLE, AND DEFINED.     THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE CONTINUES:     YOU KNOW THAT DURING THIS PEACE PROCESS, MANY ENEMIES AND DIFFICULTIES WERE SURPASSED, BUT NONE HAS BEEN SO LARGE AS THIS TRAGEDY THAT HAS SHAKEN ALL COLOMBIANS.  THE OBLIGATION THAT LIES BEFORE US IS TO KEEP OPEN THE ROAD TO PEACE THAT THE MURDERERS OF CARLOS PIZARRO WANT TO DESTROY.  ARTICLE 95 OF THE ELECTORAL CODE INDICATES THAT WHEN A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DIES, ANOTHER PERSON IN HIS OWN MOVEMENT HAS THE RIGHT TO TAKE HIS PLACE.  IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS NORM, THE GOVERNMENT WILL OFFER EVERY FACILITY FOR THE REGISTRY OF A NEW M-19 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, SO THAT HE CAN CONTINUE TO HOIST THE FLAGS OF PEACE AND PLURALISM AS IS PROPER FOR A DEMOCRATIC DEBATE.     THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAYS IN HIS MESSAGE:     I HAVE ASKED THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER AND THE PEACE ADVISER TO MEET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH M-19 REPRESENTATIVES SO THAT TOGETHER THEY MAY STUDY ALTERNATIVES TO CONFRONT SUCH A SERIOUS SITUATION. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, THE GOVERNMENT MINISTER WILL ALSO DIRECT CONTACTS WITH THE REST OF THE POLITICAL FORCES TO REQUEST THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT THE PRESENT SITUATION AND TO CONTINUE TO GIVE ALL THE NECESSARY GUARANTEES SO THAT THE ELECTORAL PROCESS MAY DEVELOP ACCORDING TO WHAT IS ESTABLISHED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND OUR LAWS.     THE MESSAGE ENDS:     I INVITE ALL COLOMBIANS WHO ARE TIRED OF SO MUCH VIOLENCE TO COME TO THE POLLS IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS AND VOTE FOR PEACE AND PLURALISM. I INVITE ALL POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES TO JOIN IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND DEFEND THE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE THREATENED BY VIOLENCE.  IT IS TIME FOR GOOD SENSE AND PRUDENCE.  IT IS TIME TO RISE TO THE OCCASION AND SHOW OUR COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY.     THIS IS THE TEXT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S MESSAGE ON THE MURDER MR. CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ.",

IT WAS RECENTLY REPORTED THAT SEVERAL OFFICERS WHO TESTIFIED DURING THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOW ATTENDING TRAINING COURSES ABROAD.  IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE MILITARY SCHOOL'S REGISTRATION BOOK FOR PERSONS ENTERING OR LEAVING THE PREMISES HAD BEEN LOST, INCLUDING THE PAGES THAT CORRESPOND TO NOVEMBER 1989. TODAY, CRISTIANI TALKED ABOUT THIS MATTER AND SAID THE JUDGE SHOULD CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE AND NOT JUST MAKE STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE PROBLEMS.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANY PROBLEM IN THE OFFICERS RETURNING TO THE COUNTRY IF A JUDGE ORDERS THAT THEY COME TO TESTIFY.  ALL THAT IS REQUIRED IS FOR THE JUDGE TO SUMMON THEM; THEY WOULD BE BROUGHT TO THE COUNTRY TO TESTIFY AND, AFTER THAT, RETURNED TO THEIR TRAINING COURSES.  GROUPS OF SOLDIERS ARE FREQUENTLY SENT ABROAD TO TAKE TRAINING COURSES TO MAKE THEM MORE PROFESSIONAL; THIS APPLIES NOT ONLY TO PERSONNEL FROM THE MILITARY SCHOOL, BUT FROM ALL ARMED FORCES UNITS.     CONCERNING THE OTHER MATTER, THE JUDGE HAS TO INVESTIGATE IT.  I BELIEVE THAT INSTEAD OF JUST STAYING THERE, THE JUDGE SHOULD CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE.  TELL ME, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY ARE BROUGHT BACK FROM SUCHITOTO OR FROM THE UNITED STATES IF THEY MUST TESTIFY BEFORE THE JUDGE?  THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL.  [END RECORDING]     THE PRESIDENT SPOKE TODAY AT THE EL SALVADOR MILITARY AIRPORT BEFORE HE LEFT FOR COSTA RICA TO ATTEND THE INAUGURATION CEREMONY OF PRESIDENT-ELECT RAFAEL CALDERON FOURNIER.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES CONDITIONING 50 PERCENT OF THE AID GIVEN TO OUR COUNTRY COULD CAUSE THE REBEL FRONT TO INCREASE THEIR ACTIONS.  HE ACCUSED THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] OF USING DIALOGUE FOR TACTICAL REASONS.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] WE HAVE STATED THAT AN ACTION OF THIS TYPE WOULD BE VERY UNTIMELY, AS IT COULD MAKE THE MOST RADICAL FMLN MEMBERS DECIDE TO CONTINUE THE WAR AND, THUS, HINDER THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.     [REPORTER] HOWEVER, [WORDS INDISTINCT] PRESSURE GOVERNMENT FOR THEM [WORDS INDISTINCT] WITH FMLN.     [CRISTIANI] I WOULD ASK THE QUESTION: WHO HAS ALWAYS SHOWED GOODWILL AND SINCERELY SOUGHT AN AGREEMENT AND WHO HAS NOT DONE THIS? HISTORY SHOWS THAT IN THE PAST, THE FMLN HAS USED THE PROPOSALS BY [JOSE NAPOLEON] DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT AND MY OWN FOR TACTICAL REASONS. IT HAS NOT BEEN THE GOVERNMENTS.  I BELIEVE THAT THE FMLN MUST UNDERSTAND AND BE PRESSURED TO REALLY SEARCH FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION. [END RECORDING]     ALSO TODAY, THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL AUTHORIZED A SPOKESMAN TO ANNOUNCE THAT TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND FMLN WILL BE RENEWED ON 16 MAY.  THE PANORAMA THAT SURROUNDS THIS NEW ENCOUNTER, HOWEVER, PRESENTS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PATTERN FROM MEETINGS IN THE PAST, BECAUSE BOTH SECTORS HAVE MET WITH POLITICAL PARTIES REPRESENTED AT THE [WORD INDISTINCT].  FURTHERMORE, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT DONE THE SAME WITH THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL FORCES, THE REBELS WILL TRY TO DO SO THIS WEEK.  UNDOUBTEDLY, THE RESULTS THAT COULD BE OBTAINED FROM THE DIALOGUE COULD BE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THOSE OBTAINED DURING PAST NEGOTIATIONS, BECAUSE ALMOST ALL THE SECTORS THAT HAVE BECOME INVOLVED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN THE NEGOTIATING DEMAND THAT THE AGREEMENTS ATTAINED BE BASED ON INTERNAL COOPERATION.",

HAVING FINISHED THEIR PRACTICAL TRAINING IN A COUNTRY WHERE APPROXIMATELY 50,000 TROOPS ARE STATIONED, THESE FPMR TERRORISTS RETURNED TO CUBA, FROM WHERE THEY TRAVELED TO EUROPE, BEFORE FINALLY RETURNING TO CHILEAN TERRITORY.

POWERFUL FORCES ARE TRYING TO JUSTIFY VIOLENCE AND WAR EVERY TIME DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS OR COMMITMENTS ARE NOT FOLLOWED OR MET.     WHEN THERE IS AN ARMED STRUGGLE AND WHEN THOUSANDS ARE KILLED ON THE BATTLEFIELD, THOSE WHO PROMOTE VIOLENCE NEVER CONCLUDE FROM THOSE USELESS KILLINGS THAT WAR IS FUTILE. THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT PEACE CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION.     IT WILL ALWAYS BE EASIER TO RECTIFY MISTAKES WHEN THE WEAKNESSES ARE POLITICAL OR WHEN ERRORS ARE MADE ON THE ROAD TO PEACE. WE CANNOT BRING THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE, AND VIOLENCE BORN OF HATRED TAKES A LONG TIME TO HEAL.     I BELIEVE, MR PRESIDENT, THAT IT WOULD BE ENCOURAGING IF YOU WERE TO RECTIFY SOME POLITICAL DECISIONS YOUR GOVERNMENT MADE FOLLOWING THE UNFORTUNATE INCIDENTS AT NANDAIME.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO REOPEN THE COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA THAT ARE CLOSED. IT IS NECESSARY TO RELEASE THE PRISONERS AND TO REVOKE THE SENTENCES IMPOSED UPON THEM AS PUNISHMENT FOR INVOLVEMENT IN THOSE INCIDENTS.  THE PEACE PLAN TO WHICH WE ARE COMMITTED OBLIGES US TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. OUR MOST SACRED COMMITMENT IS TO CONTINUE PROGRESSING ON THE PATH TOWARD DEMOCRATIZATION.     IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT AND THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS RESUME NEGOTIATIONS TO SECURE A PERMANENT END TO MILITARY ACTIONS IN NICARAGUA. THIS COULD VERY WELL BE AN ENCOURAGING EXAMPLE FOR MANY CENTRAL AMERICAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES. I OFFER YOU OUR COSTA RICAN TERRITORY FOR THE RESUMPTION OF SUCH NEGOTIATIONS. I ALSO OFFER YOU ALL THE ASSISTANCE WITHIN MY MEANS TO ENABLE SUCH NEGOTIATIONS TO TAKE PLACE.     I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WILL ATTEND THE UPCOMING INAUGURAL CEREMONY IN ECUADOR. I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE A SIGN OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE OF PEACE, A NOBLE GESTURE TOWARD RODRIGO BORJA, AND WOULD AID IN STRENGTHENING THE ECUADORAN DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IF YOU ATTENDED THE CEREMONY IN QUITO AFTER REVERSING THE SETBACKS INCURRED AS A RESULT OF ANTIDEMOCRATIC ACTIONS, SUCH AS PENALIZING THE COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA AND DEPRIVING MEN AND WOMEN OF THEIR LIBERTY.     ONLY IF WE HAVE THE STRENGTH TO CORRECT OUR MISTAKES AND THE VISION TO CONTINUE ON THE PATH OUTLINED IN THE PEACE PLAN CAN CENTRAL AMERICANS PREVENT THE CONTINUANCE OF THE ARMED AGGRESSION AGAINST OUR PEOPLES. A LATIN AMERICAN COMMITMENT TO PEACE ALSO REQUIRES EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE INDEPENDENCE AND DEMOCRACY. WE WILL NOT BE GRANTED ANOTHER POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY TO FORGE HISTORY. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE A NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR RECONCILIATION TO ALLOW TODAY'S YOUTH A DIFFERENT FUTURE, A NEW OPPORTUNITY TO PUT ASIDE THEIR WEAPONS AND TO WORK FOR A BETTER FUTURE.",

THE PURPOSE OF THIS PLAN WAS TO PRESSURE GENERAL NORIEGA TO RESIGN FROM HIS MILITARY POST IN LATE AUGUST.     THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OBJECTIVES OF THIS PLAN WERE: TO INTENSIFY AND SPREAD THE REPUDIATION OF NORIEGA WITHIN THE FDP; TO INTENSIFY AND SPREAD THE REPUDIATION OF NORIEGA'S COLLABORATORS BY MENTIONING SPECIFIC NAMES; TO CONVINCE NORIEGA THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE NORIEGA'S PANAMANIAN COLLABORATORS THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND NORIEGA ALLIES, PARTICULARLY CUBA AND NICARAGUA, THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE GOVERNMENTS THAT WERE HOSTILE TO NORIEGA, ESPECIALLY VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA, THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE FOREIGN REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS THAT DEALT WITH NORIEGA, SUCH AS THE FMLN AND THE M-19, THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; AND TO MOVE THE ANTI-NORIEGA SECTOR WITHIN THE FDP TO SUPPORT SPECIFIC ACTIONS AGAINST NORIEGA'S REGIME.     THE FDP MEMBERS, OFFICERS, AND TROOPS WERE THE TARGETS OF THIS PLAN.  WE SEE HOW SOME WERE TAKEN IN BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS PLAN.  THE TARGETS OF THIS PLAN WERE GEN NORIEGA, NORIEGA'S PANAMANIAN COLLABORATORS WITHIN THE FDP, SOME CIVILIANS, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE NORIEGA'S ALLIES, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE HOSTILE TO NORIEGA, AND FOREIGN REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATIONS THAT DEAL WITH NORIEGA. THEY IDENTIFIED ALL OF NORIEGA'S VULNERABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE VULNERABILITIES OF ALL THE TARGETS WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED.     THERE WERE CERTAIN THEMES USED IN THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS, AND THE MEDIA FELL FOR THEM MANY TIMES. THIS IS WHY WE REPEATEDLY ASKED THEM NOT TO FALL FOR THIS MISINFORMATION.     THESE THEMES INCLUDED: BY IMPOSING HIS ARBITRARY NATURE AND CORRUPTION, NORIEGA IS PERVERTING THE FDP AND PROMOTING THE DISINTEGRATION OF THAT MILITARY INSTITUTION.  THE FDP HAVE BECOME A MAFIA THAT IS HEADING TOWARD DISGRACE. THIS IS A TOPIC THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN LEAFLETS AND MANY PUBLICATIONS.     BY DISRUPTING THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AT HIS WHIM, NORIEGA IS PROVOKING A PROFOUND SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL CRISIS THAT IS RUINING THE COUNTRY. THIS IS DONE TO HIDE THOSE WHO ARE TRULY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRISIS WE ARE EXPERIENCING. THE LONGER NORIEGA REMAINS IN POWER, THE MORE PROBABLE BECOMES A U.S., CUBAN, OR SOVIET INTERVENTION.  THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS PROVOKED BY NORIEGA NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PERSONAL WELL-BEING OF THE FDP MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES.     NORIEGA'S FALL IS INEVITABLE AND THE FDP SHOULD NOT FALL WITH HIM. TO SAVE THE FDP AND THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA, THE FDP MUST REMOVE NORIEGA FROM OFFICE. THIS IS WHY THERE WERE SIREN SONGS THAT AN INTERNAL COUP WAS UNDER WAY.     THE STATE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS CASE FOR 5 MONTHS AND WE KNOW THE FUGITIVES ARE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE KNOW WHERE THEY LEFT FROM. NO ONE CAN DENY THE ASSOCIATION OF CERTAIN U.S. CITIZENS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THIS OPERATION WITH THE PANAMANIAN GROUPS THAT WERE CAPTURED.     WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE, THE WEAPONS, THE INSTRUMENTS USED FOR MISINFORMATION, THE PLANS, AND THE MAPS WITH THE TARGETS FOR VIOLENCE. IMPORTANT PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO BE KIDNAPPED HAD ALSO BEEN MARKED ON THESE MAPS. THEY HAD MARKED THE BRIDGES THAT WERE TO BE DESTROYED.     GENTLEMEN, WE KNOW THE POWER OF WEAPONS AND WE KNOW HOW TO USE THEM.  WE KNOW THE DAMAGE THEY CAN DO. THEREFORE, BEFORE THERE WAS A VIOLENT CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE AND THEIR FDP, WE WENT ONE STEP AHEAD OF THEIR PLANS. IF ARRESTS WERE MADE, IT WAS BECAUSE WE WANTED TO AVOID A CONFRONTATION WITH INEXPERIENCED GROUPS THAT ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE USED FOR THE PERSONAL BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO RECEIVED, WITH A SIREN SONG, THE PROMISE OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE'S $30 MILLION THAT ERIC ARTURO DELVALLE WAS GOING TO USE FOR SUBVERSIVE ACTS, BLOODY ACTS TO BATHE OUR PEOPLE IN BLOOD, AS IN THE CASE OF THE STRUGGLE OF OUR BROTHER COUNTRIES IN LATIN AND CENTRAL AMERICA.     WE WILL NOT PERMIT THAT. THAT IS WHY WE DECIDED TO GO ONE STEP AHEAD AND FOIL THESE PLANS THAT HAVE A CERTAIN PURPOSE AND THAT WOULD RESULT IN MOURNING AND PAIN FOR PANAMANIAN FAMILIES.     WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE AND THOSE WHO WERE ARRESTED WERE DAMN WELL ARRESTED: ALBERTO CONTE, FRED BOYD, AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES SO EDUARDO HERRERA AND FRIENDS CAN LIVE LIKE KINGS IN THE UNITED STATETS, SO THEY CAN LIVE THEIR LIVES DRINKING CHAMPAGNE AND EATING PHEASANT.     EDUARDO HERRERA WAS DISMISSED FROM A DIPLOMATIC POST FOR SMUGGLING 40 BOXES OF WHISKEY PER WEEK INTO ISRAEL.  HE IS THE KIND OF PERSON PROTECTED BY THE PENTAGON AND ELLIOTT ABRAMS. HE IS ELLIOTT ABRAMS' HERO.     THERESA WELLINGTON OF THE [U.S.] EMBASSY IN MEXICO, WHO GAVE THESE PEOPLE--WHO LEFT PANAMA FOR MEXICO-- THEIR VISAS IN 10 MINUTES BY ABRAMS' ORDERS, HAS ALSO BECOME ONE OF OUR PEOPLE'S ENEMIES.

THE SUPPLY OF GAS TO BUCARAMANGA WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THIS EVENT. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IT WILL TAKE AT LEAST 3 DAYS TO RESTORE NORMAL TRAFFIC, BECAUSE IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO USE DYNAMITE TO REMOVE ROCKS CURRENTLY BLOCKING THE HIGHWAY.     THE ATTEMPTED SABOTAGE OCCURRED AT THE 65-KM MARK ON THE BUCARAMANGA - BARRANCABERMEJA HIGHWAY, 20 KM FROM THE PLACE WHERE A MILITARY CONVOY WAS AMBUSHED LAST WEDNESDAY. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THAT AN ATTEMPTED SABOTAGE OF THE BUCARAMANGA - BARRANCABERMEJA MULTIPURPOSE PIPELINE, WHICH CARRIES PROPANE GAS, GASOLINE, AND ACPM [NOT FURTHER IDENTIFIED] HAS TAKEN PLACE.

LOSSES CAUSED BY THE SABOTAGE, WHICH HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE ELN, HAVE YET TO BE ASCERTAINED.

APPROXIMATELY 30 HEAVILY ARMED TERRORISTS, INCLUDING 6 WOMEN, BLOCKED THE HIGHWAY WITH STONES AND TREE TRUNKS AT 0600 TO INTERCEPT A BUS OWNED BY THE LOBATO CO., ANOTHER BUS OWNED BY THE LOS ANDES CO., AND TWO TRUCKS LOADED WITH FRUIT AND LUMBER. THE VEHICLES WERE TRAVELING FROM SATIPO TO HUANCAYO.     THE TERRORISTS MADE THE PASSENGERS GET OFF THE BUSES AND THEN EXAMINED THEIR IDENTIFICATION CARDS. FOUR OF THE PASSENGERS, WHO TURNED OUT TO BE ARMY MEMBERS DRESSED IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES, WERE SEPARATED FROM THE GROUP.     TWO OF THOSE IDENTIFIED AS SOLDIERS WERE KILLED IMMEDIATELY, WHILE THE OTHER TWO, APPARENTLY ARMY OFFICERS, WERE TAKEN AS HOSTAGES TOWARD ATALAYA, IN A MONTAINOUS REGION. [PASSAGE OMITTED]",

THE OUTBREAK OF THE VIOLENCE COINCIDED WITH THE REPLY FROM ALL THE REBEL GROUPS TO AN OFFICIAL PEACE PLAN AND WITH THE CONFIRMATION BY THE LABOR FEDERATIONS THAT THEY WILL HOLD A GENERAL STRIKE ON THURSDAY DESPITE GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO PREVENT IT.     THE SO-CALLED NATIONAL GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD (CNG) PROPOSED TO PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO THE HOLDING OF A SUMMIT BETWEEN THE REBEL LEADERS AND THE GOVERNMENT, DEFENSE, AND ENERGY AND MINES MINISTERS AT A PLACE AND DATE TO BE AGREED UPON.     THE DOCUMENT PROPOSED THAT THE MEDIATOR OF THE DIALOGUE BE THE DEMOCRATIC COEXISTENCE COMMISSION [COMISION DE CONVIVENCIA DEMOCRATICA], HEADED BY MSGR DARIO CASTRILLON, PRESIDENT OF THE LATIN AMERICAN BISHOPS CONFERENCE. THE DOCUMENT IS VIEWED AS THE CNG'S OFFICIAL REPLY TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PEACE PLAN.     GUERRILLAS OF THE FARC AND THE POPULAR LIBERATION ARMY (EPL) ATTACKED FOUR TOWNS IN NORTHERN COLOMBIA, LEAVING 17 GUERRILLAS AND 2 SOLDIERS DEAD AND 3 BRIDGES PARTIALLY DESTROYED.     THE DEFENSE MINISTRY REPORTED THAT FARC GUERRILLAS AMBUSHED A MILITARY CONVOY IN HUILA DEPARTMENT, KILLING THREE SOLDIERS. IT ALSO REPORTED THAT THREE REBELS WERE KILLED IN CLASHES IN SOUTHERN COLOMBIA.     IT ADDED THAT NINE GUERRILLAS OF THE ARMY OF NATIONAL LIBERATION WERE KILLED IN CLASHES WITH TROOPS OF THE 4TH INFANTRY BRIGADE ON THE BORDER OF ANTIOQUIA AND CHOCO DEPARTMENTS AND THAT SIX FARC REBELS WERE KILLED IN CAQUETA DEPARTMENT.     SUSPECTED GUERRILLAS DYNAMITED AT DUSK A BRIDGE IN BOGOTA'S URBAN CENTER, INJURING SIX PEOPLE. THE BRIDGE DID NOT SUSTAIN MAJOR DAMAGE. ANOTHER BRIDGE WAS BLOWN UP IN SANTANDER DEPARTMENT.     MILITARY SOURCES SAID THESE WERE REBEL ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE STRIKE AND THEY CHARGED THAT WORKERS, PEASANTS, AND BUS DRIVERS ARE BEING THREATENED TO FORCE THEM TO JOIN THE STRIKE.     PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO HEADED A MEETING OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL TO ADOPT MEASURES TO PREVENT DISORDERS DURING THE PLANNED STRIKE AND TO GUARANTEE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION FOR THE PEOPLE.     THE GOVERNMENT AND THE WORKERS YESTERDAY BROKE OFF THEIR TALKS AFTER BEING UNABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT ON AN INCREASE OF THE MINIMUM WAGE AND ON A FREEZE IN THE PRICES OF STAPLES.     THE STRIKE, CALLED BY THE UNITED WORKERS CONFEDERATION AND THE GENERAL CONFEDERATION OF LABOR, WILL PROTEST THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT REPLIED TO LABOR DEMANDS THEY PRESENTED IN MAY.",

THE FMLN IS SUPPOSEDLY ATTACKING MILITARY TARGETS, BUT NEITHER A JAIL NOR A SHOPPING MALL IS A MILITARY TARGET. COMMERCIAL AREAS OR AMUSEMENT PLACES ARE NOT MILITARY TARGETS. CAR BOMBS WENT OFF IN SUCH PLACES LATELY. THEY WENT OFF AT A CHAIN OF [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND AT A SHOPPING MALL. THE FMLN'S STRATEGY IS SIMPLY TO INCREASE ITS TERRORIST ACTIONS.     FOR THAT REASON, IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DESCRIBES THE FMLN AS A GROUP IN ARMS, BECAUSE THEY ARE MERELY TERRORIST CRIMINALS. [PASSAGE OMITTED]     THERE IS POLITICAL WEAKNESS, BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES ARE NOT GIVEN CLEAR MISSIONS. WE SEE THE ACTIONS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE SECURITY CORPS ARE FRUSTRATED, BECAUSE THEY SPEND TIME, EFFORT, AND MEN CAPTURING TERRORISTS WHILE THE GOVERNMENT SUBSEQUENTLY RELEASES THEM FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS.     I BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT MUST APPLY THE LAWS MORE FORCEFULLY AND STOP DECEIVING THE POPULATION WITH WORDS SUCH AS DEMOCRATIZATION AND WITH ITS GREAT POLITICAL DEMAGOGY. [END RECORDING]     FINALLY, OCHOA PEREZ CRITICIZED THE MEETING COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS WILL HOLD WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND TODAY.

HE ALSO CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT IN BRUSSELS THIS WEEK BY FPMR INTERNATIONAL SPOKESMAN MARCELO REYES.     DIAZ CARO, WHO HAS CONFESSED TO BEING ONE OF THE SNIPERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ATTACK ON PRESIDENT AUGUSTO PINOCHET, IS CURRENTLY UNDER ARREST IN THE SANTIAGO PRISON, AND, TOGETHER WITH VASILY CARILLO NOVA, HE IS NATIONAL SPOKESMAN FOR ONE OF THE FACTIONS OF THIS EXTREMIST ORGANIZATION.     DIAZ CARO, WHO WAS ARRESTED IN LATE 1986 BY THE POLICE, ANNOUNCED THAT IN \"A MATTER OF HOURS\" THEY WILL START SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS. HE EXPLAINED THAT THIS NEW PHASE OF ARMED STRUGGLE WILL BE CARRIED OUT \"FROM ARICA DOWN TO MAGALLANES.\"     AT THE SAME TIME HE REFERRED TO THE RESULTS OF THE PLEBISCITE, STATING THAT ALTHOUGH THEY RESPECT THOSE WHO VOTED \"NO,\" \"THE ONLY ASPECT OF THE VICTORY OF THE `NO' WE ACCEPT IS THAT PINOCHET LEAVE POWER.\"     IN REFERRING TO THE FPMR'S CHANGE OF STRATEGY, DIAZ CARO DISCLOSED THAT THE DECISION WAS MADE DURING A MEETING OF THE ORGANIZATION'S LEADERS LAST APRIL.     OF THIS OCCASION THEY DISCUSSED THE LINE THAT THE TERRORIST ORGANIZATION SHOULD FOLLOW. THEY ALSO DECIDED TO GIVE UP THE IDEA OF AN \"ARMED REBELLION,\" WHICH PREVAILED UNTIL THEN. THE MAIN CHARACTERISTIC OF THAT IDEA WAS THAT THE ORGANIZATION SERVED TO COMPLEMENT CLASS STRUGGLE (AS IT DID IN ITS ORIGIN IN 1983), TO SUPPORT THE PEOPLE'S REBELLION TO PARALYZE THE COUNTRY AND TO PERPETRATE ATTACKS AGAINST THE ESTABLISHED REGIME.     DIAZ CARO DISCLOSED THAT DURING THE MEETING THEY DECIDED TO REPLACE THE REBELLION WITH THE SEARCH FOR A PATRIOTIC UNITY GOVERNMENT. HE SAID THAT \"WE REALIZE THAT OUSTING THE REGIME IS SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATIONS UNDER A PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT.\"     ACCORDING TO DIAZ CARO THIS IS WHEN THEY REALIZED THE \"NEED FOR A `TRUCE' BECAUSE THEY NEEDED TO PLAN GREATER STEPS.\"     HE ADDED THAT \"THIS IS WHEN WHAT WE CALL THE `NATIONAL PATRIOTIC WAR' SURFACED. THE MAIN ISSUE OF THIS WAR IS THE ARMED STRUGGLE; WE ARE NO LONGER A MERE COMPLEMENT TO THE PEOPLE. IT REPRESENTS A QUALITATIVE STEP FORWARD AND ENTAILS GREATER RESPONSIBILITIES.\"     DIAZ CARO DISCLOSED THAT THIS NEW PHASE WILL REQUIRE A GREATER QUANTITY OF WEAPONS, MORE MEN, AND ALL THE SUPPORT NECESSARY TO OPERATE. HE SAID THAT THE MONTHS OF TRUCE WERE USED TO FULFILL THESE NEEDS.     THE SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT DURING THE MEETING THEY ALSO DECIDED ON THE NEED TO ESTABLISH A NON-ISOLATED ACTION.  \"WE THOUGHT THAT ACTIONS IN SANTIAGO, CONCEPCION, AND VALPARAISO WOULD BE THE SOLUTION, BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE.\"     DIAZ CARO EXPLAINED THAT \"THIS IS WHY WE NOW REALIZE THAT THE STRUGGLE SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT FROM ARICA DOWN TO MAGALLANES, THROUGHOUT THE TERRITORY AND IN VARIOUS FORMS.\" [CONTINUED]",

HE STRESSED THE DAMAGE TO THE ECOLOGY BECAUSE THOUSANDS OF HECTARES OF FOREST WERE DESTROYED. HE SAID THAT EUROPEAN TECHNICIANS WILL TRAVEL TO NICARAGUA NEXT WEEK TO EVALUATE THE DAMAGE.

[BARCO] I DO NOT BELIEVE YOUR QUESTION IS RELEVANT TO THE COMPOSITION AND PURPOSE OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT MEETING.  THE QUESTION ARISES FROM A LACK OF INFORMATION. COLOMBIA IS A DEMOCRACY, SUPPORTED BY A PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES.  THE SOLDIERS ARE COLOMBIANS WHO ARE COMPLYING WITH THE REQUIREMENT TO PERFORM MILITARY SERVICE. THEY ARE YOUTHS FROM ALL GROUPS, FROM THE RURAL AREAS, THE CITIES, AND FROM ALL POLITICAL PARTIES. THE OFFICERS ARE PROFESSIONALS, AND THEY DO NOT FOLLOW MILITARIST DOCTRINES.     THE ARMED FORCES MEMBERS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED--MAY I ADD ON AN INDIVIDUAL AND PERSONAL BASIS--IN ANY HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION, WILL BE ARRAIGNED BEFORE A MILITARY COURT, AND MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN EXPELLED. CIVIL COURTS HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF SOME OF THOSE CRIMES, AND SOME ARREST WARRANTS HAVE BEEN ISSUED. MILITARY JUSTICE AUTHORITIES ARE ALSO CONDUCTING LEGAL ACTIONS.

DUARTE MADE THIS CALL DURING HIS SPEECH OPENING THE 13TH INTERNATIONAL FAIR OF EL SALVADOR, IN WHICH 25 COUNTRIES ARE PARTICIPATING.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [DUARTE] I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PEACE LOVER, AND THAT IS WHY IT GRIEVES ME TO SEE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CURRENT SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND CRISIS. I, HOWEVER, BELIEVE THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WILL BE STRENGTHENED. I BELIEVE THE MINDS OF MEN WILL BE TRANSFORMED POSITIVELY, AND IDEOLOGICAL STRUGGLES--EVEN THE MOST POLARIZED ONES--WILL BE DEFINITELY SOLVED BY THE CIVILIZED MEANS OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.     I CALL ON ALL POLITICAL PARTIES TO STRENGTHEN THE CURRENT POLITICAL PROCESS AND PUT THE SACRED INTERESTS OF THE NATION BEFORE ANY OTHER INTERESTS BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO PROTECT THE REPUBLIC AND CONSOLIDATE THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION THAT BELONGS TO ALL SALVADORANS.     I ALSO WANT TO MAKE A CALL TO ALL GROUPS SO THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, WHICH WILL CULMINATE WITH THE ELECTION OF A NEW PRESIDENT NEXT YEAR, DEVELOPS WITH THE SPIRITUAL GRANDEUR THAT CORRESPONDS TO COURAGEOUS PEOPLE, WHO WISH TO SHOW THE WORLD THEIR POLITICAL MATURITY AND THEIR DESIRE TO LIVE IN PEACE.     THE ELECTORAL PROCESS WILL SLOWLY CONSOLIDATE. I BELIEVE SOONER THAN LATER, GOOD JUDGEMENT WILL PREVAIL IN THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DRIVEN MAD BY BARBARISM. [END RECORDING]     [GOMEZ] PRESIDENT DUARTE ALSO SAID THE FMLN WILL NOT STOP THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND THAT THE SALVADORAN SITUATION IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE PRESENTED BY FMLN COMMANDERS JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS AND LEONEL GONZALEZ DURING THEIR LATIN AMERICAN TOUR.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [DUARTE] IT IS TRUE THAT THE ENEMIES OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL GO ON CONDUCTING THEIR TERRORIST AND DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS. THOSE ACTIONS, HOWEVER, WILL NOT AT ALL AFFECT THE PROGRESS MADE BY OUR DEMOCRATIC STRUGGLE. THE TRUTH IS THAT OUR CRISIS IS AS LARGE AS THE EFFORT WE HAVE MADE TO FACE IT. THAT EFFORT GOES BEYOND OUR BORDERS AND REACHES THE ENTIRE WORLD.     THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CHANGES THAT BEGAN TO TAKE PLACE IN EL SALVADOR ARE [WORD INDISTINCT] AND HAVE BEGAN TO SHOW THEIR RESULTS, DESPITE THE DESPERATE ACTIONS THE FMLN-FDR IS CONDUCTING ABROAD IN ORDER TO COUNTER THE RESULTS OF THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE.     THE FOREIGNERS WHO CAME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS FAIR AS WELL AS THE DISTINGUISHED OAS GENERAL ASSEMBLY DELEGATES WILL CONFIRM THAT THE SALVADORAN SITUATION IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT CIRCULATED ABROAD AND DISSEMINATED AS PART OF AN FMLN -FDR DISINFORMATION PLAN.     THE REPRESENTATIVES OF OUR LOCAL SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENTS HAVE SAID ABROAD THAT THERE IS REPRESSION IN EL SALVADOR.  ONLY A GOVERNMENT THAT IMPOSES ITSELF BY FORCE ON ITS PEOPLE CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A REPRESSIVE GOVERNMENT. OUR COUNTRY NEVER ENJOYED SO MUCH FREEDOM AS NOW AND ITS RULERS WERE NEVER CHOSEN SO FREELY AS THEY ARE NOW. [END RECORDING]     [GOMEZ] [WORD INDISTINCT] PRESIDENT DUARTE SAID THE 18TH OAS REGULAR MEETING REPRESENTS THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES' SUPPORT FOR THE SALVADORAN DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.",

HE SAID THAT THE PEOPLE'S RESOLUTE \"NO\" IN THE REFERENDUM ON 5 OCTOBER MUST NOW BE FOLLOWED BY THE OVERTHROW OF PINOCHET AND THE RETURN TO DEMOCRACY. THE FORMER SENATOR SAID THAT THE MOST URGENT CONDITION FOR THE PATH INTO THE FUTURE IS THE CREATION OF A BROAD UNITY OF ALL OPPOSITION FORCES WHICH CAN WIN A VICTORY OVER PINOCHET. HE SAID THAT THE COMMUNIST PARTY ALSO CONSIDERS COOPERATION, IN PARTICULAR WITH THE SOCIALISTS, A DECISIVE STEP.     HE SAID THAT QUITE A FEW THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN CHILE THROUGH THE BROAD MASS MOVEMENT. HIGH OFFICERS WHO SERVED THE DICTATOR MOST LOYALLY HAVE HAD TO RESIGN NOW UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PUBLIC. IN ADDITION, IT HAS JUST BEEN REPORTED THAT EL SIGLO, THE COMMUNIST PARTY NEWSPAPER, WILL BE PUBLISHED AGAIN LEGALLY.     ASKED ABOUT THE PRESENT CONDITIONS OF THE STRUGGLE, TEITELBOIM SAID THAT THE PROGRESSIVE FORCES IN CHILE, WHO HAD TO PAY A HIGH PRICE FOR THEIR RESISTANCE IN THE PINOCHET'S 15-YEAR RULE, CONTINUE TO BE EXPOSED TO PERSECUTION, IMPRISONMENT, AND THREATS OF MURDER. THE COMMUNIST PARTY, WHICH HAS HAD THE LARGEST NUMBER OF CASUALTIES AND MISSING AND TORTURED PEOPLE SINCE THE DICTATORSHIP WAS ESTABLISHED, CONTINUES TO BE BANNED.     NONETHELESS, THE COUNTRY IS CAUGHT UP IN A WAVE OF MOBILIZATION OF THE PEOPLE. VOLODIA TEITELBOIM CONFIRMED THAT THE COMMUNIST PARTY SUPPORTS THE DEMAND MADE BY THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE TO HOLD THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS PROMISED BY THE MILITARY JUNTA FOR LATE 1989 AT AN EARLIER DATE, AND TO NOMINATE A COMMON PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. IN ADDITION, THE CONSTITUTION--ON THE BASIS OF WHICH PINOCHET INTENDS TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE UNTIL MARCH 1990 DESPITE HIS DEFEAT THROUGH THE REFERENDUM--MUST BE ABOLISHED TO ALLOW THE PEOPLE TO DECIDE ON THE COUNTRY'S FUTURE IN FREEDOM.     VOLODIA TEITELBOIM PAID TRIBUTE TO THE GDR'S CONSISTENT POSITION IN WORD AND DEED AS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY WITH THE CHILEAN PEOPLE. HE SAID THAT HUNDREDS OF PATRIOTS FROM HIS COUNTRY HAVE FOUND A TEMPORARY HOME IN THE GDR, WHERE THEY CAN LIVE AND WORK.",

THE MIR ADDED THAT IT WILL \"TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY SITUATION\" AND THAT IT WILL USE THE ELECTORAL PROCESS BY REGISTERING A LEFTIST PARTY.     MIR SPOKESMAN JECAR NEGHME TALKED TO THE PRESS YESTERDAY ABOUT THE RESOLUTIONS APPROVED AT THE LATEST MIR CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON 6 AND 7 NOVEMBER.  HE SAID THAT IT WAS THE FIRST MEETING HELD IN CHILE SINCE JULY 1973.     NEGHME STATED THAT IN ADDITION TO POLITICAL ISSUES, THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE ALSO PAID HOMAGE TO RAUL PELLEGRIN AND CECILIA MAGNI, MEMBERS OF THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT WHO WERE KILLED RECENTLY.     IN A PUBLIC COMMUNIQUE, THE MIR CRITICIZED THE OPPOSITION PARTIES FOR \"NOT LISTENING TO THE NATIONAL CLAMOR FOR PINOCHET'S RESIGNATION\" AND FOR GIVING PRIORITY TO \"A STRATEGY OF SHADY DEALS AT THE TOP LEVEL.\"     THE COMMUNIQUE ADDS: \"ALTHOUGH THE DOCUMENT RELEASED BY THE 16 POLITICAL PARTIES FOCUSES ON SOME OF THE PEOPLE'S DEMANDS, ITS MAIN DEFECT IS THAT BY INCLUDING THE DEMANDS AS PART OF A NEGOTIATING STRATEGY AND BY MAKING THE MOBILIZATION TASKS UNCLEAR, THE DEMANDS OF THE CHILEAN PEOPLE WILL NOT BE HEARD.\"     THE MIR ALSO SAID THAT NEXT YEAR IT WILL STRUGGLE FOR THE IMMEDIATE END OF THE REGIME AND THE CONSTITUTION, THE CREATION OF A PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT, THE ELECTION OF A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, THE STRENGTHENING OF THE UNITED LEFT, AND THE PREPARATION OF A \"DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR PROGRAM\" FOR THE COUNTRY.     THE COMMUNIQUE SAYS THAT TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS THE MIR WILL PROMOTE A TACTIC \"TO DESTABILIZE THE REGIME, TO MAKE THE INSTITUTIONS ILLEGITIMATE, TO DEMOCRATIZE THE COUNTRY, AND TO ACCUMULATE GREATER FORCE.\"     THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO POINTS OUT THAT THE MIR WILL USE \"THE LIMITED POSSIBILITY OF PARTICIPATING IN ELECTIONS BEGINNING IN 1988.\" THIS IS WHY THE MIR SUPPORTS THE REGISTRATION OF A LEFTIST PARTY: TO PREVENT THE EXCLUSION OF THE LEFT AND \"TO PROMOTE THE GAINS OF THE PEOPLE.\"",

THE REBEL LEADERS MAINTAIN THEY HAVE MET ON FIVE OCCASIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT WITHIN A FRAMEWORK OF CONSULTATIONS AND COORDINATION PROPOSED BY PRESIDENT RODRIGO BORJA. ACCORDING TO THEM, ONE OF THE MEETINGS INVOLVED MINISTER VALLEJO HIMSELF, WHO REPORTEDLY INTRODUCED THEM TO A DELEGATE OF PRESIDENT BORJA FOR FURTHER TALKS.     NEVERTHELESS, VALLEJO DID NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF HOLDING TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN THE COUNTRY. FEBRES-CORDERO'S ADMINISTRATION REFUSED TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE ALFARO LIVES DAMMIT AND FREE HOMELAND MONTONERAS GUERRILLA GROUPS BECAUSE IT CONSIDERED THEM TO BE TERRORIST GROUPS; IT ACTUALLY ATTACKED THESE GROUPS TO THE POINT OF ALMOST ELIMINATING THEM.     VALLEJO POINTED OUT THAT HOLDING TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS WOULD BE A POSITIVE STEP. HE RECALLED THAT THE COLOMBIAN ADMINISTRATION OF BELISARIO BETANCUR BEGAN A DIALOGUE WITH GENUINE REVOLUTIONARY ARMIES TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN THAT COUNTRY. HE ASKED: WHY CAN WE NOT HOLD TALKS HERE, WHERE THE GUERRILLAS ARE STILL AT AN EMBRYONIC PHASE?     THE POSSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT-GUERRILLAS TALKS HAS BEEN VIEWED DIFFERENTLY. NATIONAL CONGRESS PRESIDENT WILFRIDO LUCERO SAID ON 25 NOVEMBER THAT THE CONGRESS IS NEITHER TASKED NOR EMPOWERED TO HOLD TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS. LUCERO REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THE ALLEGED TALKS, SAYING THAT HE HAS RECEIVED NO INFORMATION IN THIS REGARD. HE ADDED: THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS ARE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF OTHERS; IT IS NOT A CONCERN OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS.     ACCORDING TO JULIO CESAR TRUJILLO, A FORMER PRESIDENT OF POPULAR DEMOCRACY, TALKS WITH GUERRILLAS WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY HAVE USEFUL IDEAS, SOME OF WHICH COULD BE IMPLEMENTED. HE ADDED THAT NOT EVERYTHING ADVOCATED BY THE GUERRILLAS CAN BE CARRIED OUT BECAUSE THERE ARE OBSTACLES FACING THE GOOD OFFICES OF THE CURRENT RULERS.     MEANWHILE, THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PARTY OF FORMER PRESIDENT LEON FEBRES-CORDERO EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THIS POSSIBILITY. IT WILL MEET TOMORROW TO DISCUSS THE TOPIC AND ISSUE AN STATEMENT. MARCO LARA, PRESIDENT OF THAT PARTY AND PUBLIC INFORMATION SECRETARY DURING THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION, REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THIS.     WHILE IN QUITO [AS HEARD], COMMANDERS JOAQUIN AND JAVIER ARE PROPOSING A BROAD AND DIRECT DIALOGUE WITH RODRIGO BORJA'S REGIME; IN GUAYAQUIL, LEADERS JUAN CUBIA AND EDGAR PRIAS, BOTH IN PRISON, AND PATRICIO BAQUERIZO ARE REJECTING A DEMAND THAT THE MOVEMENT RESPECT THE LAW.",

ACCORDING TO WHAT THE CARTAGENA AGREEMENT BOARD, A TECHNICAL-COMMUNITY INTEGRATION ORGANIZATION, REPORTED TODAY, THE POLITICAL AGREEMENTS THAT WERE ADOPTED BY THE ANDEAN-EUROPEAN JOINT COMMISSION IN THE MEETINGS HELD IN BRUSSELS IN APRIL ARE NOW BEING IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE HOLDING OF THESE TALKS.     THE FIRST MEETING IN LIMA WILL BE TO DISCUSS FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES SUCH AS THE BETTER USE OF THE GENERALIZED PREFERENTIAL RATES SYSTEM THAT IS IMPLEMENTED BY THE EEC, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE TRADE, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANDEAN EXPORTS.     THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE AGREEMENTS NOT ONLY ENCOMPASS THE STRENGTHENING OF TRADE TIES, BUT ALSO INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION FOR DEVELOPMENT.     PETER HEISLER, THE CHIEF OF THE EEC DELEGATION, SAID THAT THIS MEETING SHOWS \"OUR WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE.\"     ACCORDING TO STATISTICS PROVIDED BY THE CARTAGENA AGREEMENT BOARD, IN 1986 THE ANDEAN GROUP, COMPRISED OF BOLIVIA, ECUADOR, COLOMBIA, PERU, AND VENEZUELA, RECORDED A DEFICIT OF $266 MILLION IN ITS TRADE WITH EEC COUNTRIES.     THIS DEFICIT IN ANDEAN TRADE, WHICH HAS NOT BEEN RECORDED SINCE 1982, WHEN THE FOREIGN DEBT CRISIS EXPLODED IN ANDEAN GROUP COUNTRIES, IS CAUSED BY THE FALL BY ALMOST 23 PERCENT OF ANDEAN EXPORTS, WHICH IN 1988 TOTALED $3.847 BILLION.     THIS DEFICIT IS ALSO CAUSED BY AN INCREASE OF 18 PERCENT IN ANDEAN IMPORTS FROM EEC COUNTRIES, WORTH $4.113 BILLION.     BETWEEN 1970 AND 1986, THE ANDEAN GROUP ACCUMULATED A TRADE DEFICIT OF $2.175 BILLION WITH THE GROUP OF 12.     DURING THIS PERIOD, ANDEAN EXPORTS TOTALED $54.795 BILLION, WHILE IMPORTS TOTALED $56.970 BILLION.     THE COOPERATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CARTAGENA AGREEMENT BOARD MEMBERS AND EEC COUNTRIES WAS SIGNED ON 17 DECEMBER 1983 IN CARTAGENA, COLOMBIA.     LATER, THE CONGRESSES OF ALL THE COUNTRIES COMPRISING THE ANDEAN GROUP APPROVED THE AGREEMENT WHILE NEGOTIATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THEM, PARTICULARLY REGARDING TRADE, HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE SINCE APRIL 1988.",

WE HAVE REINFORCEMENTS FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE AND ARE WORKING ON A JOINT PLAN TO HELP MINIMIZE TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT THEY WILL TRY TO CARRY OUT AND ARE CARRYING OUT AT THIS VERY MOMENT.     JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, RIGHT NOW WE ARE WAITING FOR A DEMONSTRATION THAT IS TO BEGIN AT THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.

WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN IN USULUTAN AND IN SAN FRANCISCO MORAZAN WHERE THESE PEOPLE ATTACKED WITHOUT CARING WHETHER THEY DESTROYED PRIVATE PROPERTY OR HOMES--EVEN KILLING INNOCENT CIVILIANS. WE ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM THIS HERE. WE HAVE A STRATEGY. WE EVEN BELIEVE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF AN ATTACK FROM INSIDE THE GENERAL HEADQUARTERS--IT IS VERY POSSIBLE, THEY HAVE DONE IT BEFORE. I REMEMBER WHEN THEY BOMBED THE SERVICE STATION HERE, DESTROYING THREE OR FOUR VEHICLES, AND THEY ALSO PLACED BOMBS INSIDE THE GENERAL DIRECTORATE OFFICE. WE ARE DOING ALL WE CAN TO TRY TO AVOID THESE PROBLEMS. WE ARE READY TO FACE ANY SITUATION.

[GUZMAN] YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THESE ARE MAINLY MILITARY PLANS WHICH WE CANNOT VERY WELL DISCLOSE IN ADVANCE.  IF I STARTED GIVING OUT THIS INFORMATION, I WOULD BE EXPOSING OUR SECURITY OPERATION FOR THE MEETING. ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT WE ARE TAKING THIS SITUATION VERY SERIOUSLY. WE HAVE REINFORCEMENTS FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE.

GOOD MORNING.     [VIDES] GOOD MORNING.     [REPORTER] VIOLENCE HAS INCREASED RECENTLY AND THE PEOPLE ARE EXTREMELY WORRIED. WHAT ARE THE ARMED FORCES DOING TO GUARANTEE THE PEOPLE'S WELFARE?     [VIDES] THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S CONCERN ABOUT INCREASED TERRORIST VIOLENCE IS UNDERSTANDABLE. WE MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT TERRORIST ACTS ALWAYS ESCALATE WHEN IMPORTANT EVENTS ARE EXPECTED. THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN ONLY IN OUR COUNTRY; WE RECENTLY SAW IT IN SEOUL, BEFORE THE OLYMPICS, WHEN GROUPS RESORTED TO VIOLENCE TO PROVOKE THE AUTHORITIES AND PREVENT AN INTERNATIONAL EVENT FROM TAKING PLACE.     AN OAS MEETING IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY IN A FEW DAYS. THE EVENT IS BEING THREATENED BY A NUMBER OF ACTS, PARTICULARLY TERRORIST ACTS IN THE SAN BENITO, MAX DIAZ, ESCALON, AND SAN FRANCISCO NEIGHBORHOODS.  THE TERRORISTS BELIEVE THE PEOPLE WILL PROTEST AGAINST THE OAS MEETING IF THEY CAUSE TERROR IN THOSE AREAS.     WE ARE EXPECTING FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM LATIN AMERICA, CENTRAL AMERICA, AND THE UNITED STATES, WHOM THE TERRORISTS BELIEVE WILL CALL OFF THE MEETING BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY. THAT IS THE MAIN REASON FOR THE INCREASED VIOLENCE.     YOU HAVE SEEN THAT WE HAVE INCREASED PATROL OPERATIONS RECENTLY. PATROLS ARE ALSO BEING CARRIED OUT AROUND THE VOLCANOES NEAR SAN SALVADOR. SECURITY MEASURES ARE ALSO BEING IMPLEMENTED ON THE PERIPHERY OF SAN SALVADOR AND AROUND THE MEETING VENUE, BUT I CANNOT GIVE YOU THE DETAILS. THERE IS ALSO A COMPLETE SECURITY PLAN FOR THE OFFICIALS WHO WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE OAS MEETING.     WE ARE READY TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF AN INCIDENT TO A MINIMUM. HOWEVER, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HONEST AND I MUST ADMIT THERE IS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY OF SABOTAGE OR A TERRORIST ACT. THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT IT WILL AFFECT THE SECURITY MEASURES IN THE AREA OF THE MEETING. FOR EXAMPLE, A BLACKOUT CAN BE CAUSED BY CUTTING OFF AN ELECTRIC LINE IN A DISTANT AREA.     [REPORTER] GENERAL, THE FMLN'S ATTACKS HAVE NOT BEEN SO OVERWHELMING IN THE PAST, YET NOW THOSE ATTACKS ARE ATTAINING CONSIDERABLE MILITARY SUCCESS. DO THE FMLN'S MILITARY ACTIONS MEAN IT IS SUPERIOR TO THE ARMED FORCES?     [VIDES] WE CANNOT CONCEIVE THEIR MILITARY SUPERIORITY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I HAVE NOTICED THE GUERRILLA LEADERS ARE CURRENTLY VISITING DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY THE CONTADORA GROUP MEMBERS. THEY ARE TRYING TO GAIN SUPPORT FOR READING A STATEMENT AT THE OAS MEETING, AND THEY ARE ALSO TRYING TO PRESSURE THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT INTO NEGOTIATING WITH THEM. THIS PROVES THE REBELS HAVE FAILED MILITARILY, AND THAT FAILURE HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY OUR LARGE-SCALE OPERATIONS IN NORTHERN CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT AND USULUTAN DEPARTMENT, IN THE EAST OF THE COUNTRY.     THE REBELS HAVE TRIED TO BRING THE WAR TO URBAN AREAS.  HOWEVER, THE PLANS OF SUBVERSIVE GROUPS--I SHOWED YOU THE DOCUMENTS ON THEIR FIRE PLAN IN ANOTHER MEETING--DID NOT INCLUDE THE TYPE OF TERRORIST ACTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN LATELY. INSTEAD, THEY PLANNED A GENERAL UPRISING AND STRIKE BEFORE THE ELECTIONS.     THIS PROVES, AS I SAID, THAT THE SUBVERSIVES COULD NOT DEVELOP THEIR FIRE PLAN. THEY HAVE CARRIED OUT SEVERAL ACTS BUT THEY HAVE FAILED TO ACHIEVE THE EXPECTED RESULTS.  THIS IS LIKE HAVING A CINEMA SHOW A MOVIE EVERY DAY WITH NO-ONE TURNING UP TO SEE IT.     THE SUBVERSIVES ARE TRYING TO CARRY OUT THIS TYPE OF EVENT RIGHT NOW TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF MILITARY STRENGTH, SO THE OAS WILL PASS A RESOLUTION RECOMMENDING NEGOTIATION TO SOLVE THE CONFLICT.     FURTHERMORE, THE REBELS ARE TRYING TO DISCREDIT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND BOYCOTT OUR NEXT ELECTIONS BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE DEMORALIZED BY TERRORISM AND LACK THE WILL TO PARTICIPATE IN POLITICS, WHICH MAKES THE ELECTION RESULTS UNSATISFACTORY.

THE BILL, WHICH WAS DISCUSSED IN THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES AND THE SENATE, ESTABLISHES PRISON TERMS RANGING FROM 10 TO 20 YEARS. IT WAS IMMEDIATELY SENT TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH FOR PROMULGATION.     THE BILL WAS APPROVED 3 MONTHS AFTER PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA PRESENTED IT TO CONGRESS ON 28 JULY, WHEN GARCIA COMPLETED THE 3D YEAR OF A 5-YEAR TERM OF OFFICE WHICH BEGAN IN 1985.     THE PROVISIONS APPROVED BY CONGRESS AMEND 6 ARTICLES IN SECTION 8, VOLUME 2 OF THE PERUVIAN PENAL CODE, ADDING MORE SEVERE SENTENCES AND THE MEANS FOR EXPANDING COURT ACTIONS AGAINST SUBVERSION.     A PRISON TERM OF 20 YEARS OR MORE WILL BE IMPOSED ON THOSE WHO CAUSE ANXIETY, ALARM, OR TERROR AMONG THE POPULATION OR ANY PART OF IT, ACTS AGAINST A PERSON'S LIFE OR HEALTH, OR ACTS AGAINST PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY IF SUCH ACTS IMPAIR THE COMMUNITY'S BASIC SERVICES.     IN ALL CASES, THE INSTIGATORS OR MASTERMINDS, THE PRINCIPALS IN THE SECOND DEGREE, AND THE ACCOMPLICES WILL RECEIVE THE SAME SENTENCES AS THE PERPETRATORS.     MORE SEVERE SENTENCES HAVE ALSO BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR CASES IN WHICH A PERPETRATOR BELONGS TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT USES TERRORISM AS A MEANS TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS, INCLUDING THE MAOIST \"SHINING PATH\" ORGANIZATION AND THE MRTA.     SUPPORTING, APPROVING, OR PRAISING TERRORIST ACTS CAN BE PUNISHED WITH PRISON TERMS OF 5 YEARS OR MORE, AND A 5-YEAR PRISON TERM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE CRIME OF MAKING, PURCHASING, STEALING, OR STORING WEAPONS OR EXPLOSIVES FOR THE PURPOSE OF TERRORISM.

THE NOTE DENOUNCES THE MASSACRE OF 14 FISHERMEN, INCLUDING TWO COLOMBIANS WHOM THE VENEZUELAN ARMED FORCES ACCUSED OF BEING SUBVERSIVES.     THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT DECIDED THAT IT WOULD NOT BE SCOLDED BY COLOMBIA, SO THE VENEZUELAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SENT A NOTE TO OUR FOREIGN MINISTRY WHICH SAID THAT VENEZUELA REJECTED THE TERMS USED IN THE COLOMBIAN PROTEST NOTE.     COLOMBIA HAS SENT 17 FOREIGN MINISTRY NOTES TO VENEZUELA IN THE PAST 2 YEARS, ALL CONCERNING INCIDENTS THAT HAVE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECTED COLOMBIAN CITIZENS.  ONLY 2 OF THE 17 PROTEST NOTES HAVE RECEIVED A REPLY, AND THEY NEVER INCLUDED THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS REQUESTED BY OUR GOVERNMENT.     THE LAST NOTE REPRESENTS A PROTEST FROM OUR GOVERNMENT FOR THE MURDER OF JOSE ANTONIO AREGUA AND JUSTO PASTOR CEBALLOS ON 29 OCTOBER. THEY WERE ASSASSINATED ALONG WITH 12 VENEZUELAN CITIZENS WHEN THE VENEZUELAN ARMY MISTOOK THEM FOR NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY REBELS IN CANO COLORADA, ARAUCA DEPARTMENT, ALONG THE VENEZUELAN BORDER.

ILDEGAR PEREZ, VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR TO COLOMBIA, PERSONALLY REFERRED TO THE STATE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES:     [BEGIN RECORDING] [PEREZ] LET US SAY THAT RELATIONS AT THIS POINT ARE DELICATE, BUT I WOULD NOT CHARACTERIZE THEM AS CRITICAL OR EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. [END RECORDING]     THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT HAS ORDERED THAT THE TWO SURVIVORS OF THE 29 OCTOBER MASSACRE AT THE BORDER BE TRIED. MOREOVER, THE DISPUTE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES IS BEING EXPLOITED IN THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.  VERY FEW, HOWEVER, DARE TO SPEAK THE TRUTH ABOUT THE SITUATION.     [VENEZUELAN DEPUTY JUVENCIO PULGAR] [BEGIN RECORDING] WE HAVE DISPUTES AND WE SHOULD NOT COVER THEM UP. COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA HAVE THINGS TO PROTEST ABOUT, BUT ONLY A DIALOGUE WILL LEAD TO AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THESE DISPUTES. [END RECORDING]",

AND WITH IT CHANGED THE POLICIES AND TOOLS THAT BUCHI'S TEAM WILL HAVE TO RESORT TO UNTIL LATE 1989 AND THAT ARE NOW MUCH MORE DEPENDENT THAN BEFORE ON THE GOVERNMENT'S POLITICAL OBJECTIVES. ONE OPTION IS TO KEEP ON DOING \"MORE OF THE SAME,\" TO IGNORE THE NEW CONTEXT THAT HAS DEVELOPED SINCE 5 OCTOBER, TO DEFUSE THE MONETARY TIME BOMB AND TO APPLY A TIGHT TOURNIQUET TO THE ECONOMY TO PREVENT RENEWED OUTBREAKS OF HIGHER PRICES.     THE INFLATION \"BOGEYMAN\" IS BEGINNING TO MAKE HIS PRESENCE FELT (THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX, CPI, IS EXPECTED TO BE UP 1.3 TO 1.5 PERCENT THIS MONTH), AND EXPLANATIONS ABOUND. GERARDO ACEITUNO, THE HEAD OF THE FORECASTING WORKSHOP OF THE LABOR ECONOMY PROGRAM, ATTRIBUTES THE MOUNTING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES TO THE IMPACT OF THE WAGE HIKE AND HIGHER INTERNATIONAL INTEREST RATES ON DOMESTIC PRICES. HE RECALLS THAT THE PRICES OF FARM PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN \"VIRTUALLY FROZEN FOR A YEAR\" AND THAT THIS EXPLAINS THE HUGE GAP BETWEEN THE WHOLESALE PRICE INDEX, WHICH FELL ONE PERCENT DURING THE PAST 12 MONTHS, AND THE CPI, WHICH ROSE 12 PERCENT DURING THE SAME PERIOD. \"THE SITUATION COULD NOT BE SUSTAINED, EXCEPT IF BUSINESSMEN WANTED TO SACRIFICE THEIR PROFIT MARGINS, WHICH HAVE SO FAR NOT BEEN AFFECTED, BECAUSE THE VAT WAS CUT.\"     JUAN VILLARZU, IN CONTRAST, PLACES MOST OF THE BLAME FOR THE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES ON THE EXCESSIVE QUANTITY OF MONEY. ODDLY ENOUGH, HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTY THAT DEVELOPED AFTER THE VICTORY OF THE NO VOTE IS PRESUMABLY HAVING AN EFFECT SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE \"MINI-ADJUSTMENT.\"  HE REPORTS THAT SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSMEN ARE POSTPONING THEIR INVESTMENT PLANS, AND THUS THEIR DEMAND FOR CREDIT HAS FALLEN OFF. THE DILEMMA FACING THEM AND OTHER \"ECONOMIC AGENTS\" IS WHETHER TO SPEND THE MONEY OR TO DEPOSIT IT. THE CENTRAL BANK COMES INTO PLAY HERE, BECAUSE \"NOT HAVING TO COMPETE WITH THE BANKS, IT CAN BEGIN SOAKING UP SOME OF THE MONEY IN CIRCULATION WITHOUT BOOSTING INTEREST RATES TOO MUCH. MOREOVER, THEY ARE ALREADY QUITE HIGH: 5 PERCENT FOR 90-DAY OPERATIONS, AS AGAINST 4.2 PERCENT DURING THE FIRST HALF.\" IN ADDITION, IT COULD RESORT TO ITS SIZABLE MONETARY RESERVES AND \"BURN UP\" FOREIGN EXCHANGE ON HIGHER IMPORTS TO ABSORB SOME OF THE EXCESS LIQUIDITY.  \"I'M THINKING ABOUT DEVALUATIONS (OF THE PESO) SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE ONES THIS YEAR.\"     OPTIONS AFTER THE NO VICTORY     IN ANY EVENT, THE LARGE MASS OF MONEY IN CIRCULATION AND THE EXISTING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES (WHATEVER THEIR CAUSE) \"CONSTITUTE AN EXPLOSIVE SITUATION,\" WHICH ACCORDING TO VILLARZU THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT IGNORE. BECAUSE \"IF IT HAS ANY POLITICAL ACCOMPLISHMENT LEFT, IT IS THE VICTORY OVER INFLATION.\" AND THE TIGHTENING UP WILL BE EVEN MORE SEVERE IF THE FINANCE MINISTER INSISTS ON ACHIEVING A 5-PERCENT RISE IN THE CPI IN 1989, AS THE DRAFT BUDGET SENT TO THE JUNTA CALLS FOR. EVEN THE CENTRAL BANK REGARDS THIS GOAL AS DANGEROUS. A HIGH-LEVEL CENTRAL BANK EXECUTIVE SAID THAT \"IT IS VALID TO AIM FOR AN INFLATION RATE LIKE THAT IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, BUT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT (WHICH WOULD TRIGGER A HEAVY CONCENTRATION OF SPENDING) REMAINS HIGH.\"     ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC CARD ARE THE ALREADY VISIBLE AND STRONG PRESSURES THAT THE RIGHT HAS BEGUN TO APPLY SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL INCREASE SPENDING IN 1989 OR AT LEAST NOT REDUCE IT. THE RIGHT ALSO WANTS THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT ARE MORE POPULIST IN NATURE OR THAT HAVE LESS VISIBLE EFFECTS ON VOTERS. SIGNIFICANTLY, EXPERTS ON BUCHI'S OWN TEAM ARE THE ONES WHO ARE ADMITTING THAT POLITICAL DEMANDS CAN BE GIVEN TO SOME EXTENT WITHOUT IGNORING CERTAIN PRINCIPLES.  GAINING GROUND, AS A RESULT, ARE AN INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE (\"TO PAVE THE WAY FOR HIGHER PAY IN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE\") AND FURTHER CUTS IN THE VAT (THE RUMOR OF A CUT TO 12 PERCENT WAS ALREADY MAKING THE ROUNDS BEFORE THE PLEBISCITE) AND IN THE TAX ON CAPITAL.  BUT THE PRIVATIZATION OF ENTERPRISES IS STILL STRONGLY SUPPORTED AS WELL. EVERYTHING POINTS IN THE SAME DIRECTION: \"REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE PUBLIC AND GOVERNMENT SECTOR AND, AT THE SAME TIME, NARROW THE MANEUVERING ROOM ON TAXES FOR A GOVERNMENT DIFFERENT FROM THIS ONE.\" IF IT IS SIMILAR, SO MUCH THE BETTER.

JARAMILLO ACKNOWLEDGED, HOWEVER, THAT THE GUERRILLA GROUPS IN URABA HAVE SHIFTED FROM SUBVERSION TO ABSURD ACTS OF TERRORISM AND VANDALISM THAT CANNOT BE COMPARED TO ACTS ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY.     THE LEFTIST LEADER DESCRIBED THIS TERRORIST ESCALADE AS ONE OF THE MAJOR OBSTACLES TO THE REGION'S ACHIEVING THE SOCIAL PACT THAT IT URGENTLY NEEDS.     THE CONGRESSMAN FELT THAT THE SHUTDOWN OF THE UNIONS HAS DEPRIVED THEM OF SPOKESMEN AND HE RECALLED THAT URABA HAS ACHIEVED ITS WEALTH THROUGH PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT.     MORE SELF-CRITICISM     SENATOR ALBERTO ROJAS PUYO, ONE OF THE PATRIOTIC UNION CONGRESSMEN, CONTENDED YESTERDAY THAT THE RESIGNATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE CUT, JORGE CARRILLO, OUGHT TO HELP PROMPT THE LEFT TO MAKE A SERIES OF RECTIFICATIONS.     ROJAS SAID: \"JORGE CARRILLO'S LETTER OF RESIGNATION AS PRESIDENT OF THE CUT CONTAINS VERY IMPORTANT PROPOSALS NOT ONLY FOR THE ORGANIZATION BUT ALSO FOR ALL DEMOCRATIC FORCES. I AM GLAD THAT HIS RESIGNATION WAS NOT ACCEPTED AND I SEE IN THIS DEVELOPMENT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE FORCES OF THE LEFT WILL BEGIN A SERIOUS PROCESS OF REFLECTION AND NECESSARY RECTIFICATION SO THAT THEIR STRUGGLES ARE UNDERSTOOD AND TAKEN UP BY THE WORKING CLASS AND THE PEOPLE AT LARGE.     \"SOME OF CARRILLO'S PROPOSALS ARE, WITHOUT DOUBT, DEBATABLE, BUT THE INDISCRIMINATE MIX OF ACTIONS IS UNQUESTIONABLY DOING GREAT DAMAGE TO THE COUNTRY AND, MOST OF ALL, TO THE LEFT. A CLEAR LINE MUST BE DRAWN IN WORD AND IN DEED WITH RESPECT TO VIOLENCE. THE FACT THAT SUCH CRUCIAL ASPECTS FOR COLOMBIA'S DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT WERE DEBATED WITHIN A MAJOR LABOR FEDERATION SHOWS THAT THIS CLASS CAN PLAY A GUIDING ROLE FOR THE PEOPLE AT LARGE.     \"THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT ALONG WITH THE NECESSARY REFORMS, THE UNITY OF THE FEDERATION AND ITS CAPACITY FOR ALLIANCES AND GRASSROOTS MOBILIZATION EMERGE STRENGTHENED.\"",

THE ASSEMBLY OFFERED TO LOOSEN LEGAL [WORD INDISTINCT] ON THE ARMED FORCES TO WIN THE WAR.     SOME GROUPS BELIEVE THE COUNTRY ENTERED A CRISIS WITH THE 15 OCTOBER 1979 MILITARY COUP. SINCE THEN, EL SALVADOR HAS SUFFERED A CIVIL WAR THAT IS GETTING WORSE AND CAUSING MORE CASUALTIES. THERE ARE NOW TWO DISTURBING CHANGES IN THE WAR: FIRST, CORPSES ARE BEING DUMPED ON THE ROADSIDE, WHICH REMINDS US OF THE EARLY 1980'S WHEN DEATH SQUADS WERE ACTIVE. SECOND, URBAN GUERRILLA ACTIVITY IS INCREASING. THE ARMED FORCES ARE JUSTIFIABLY CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE ISSUES.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] I NEVER TALK ABOUT DEATH SQUADS.

THE ARMY IS DETERMINED, AND IS MAKING ALL THE NECESSARY EFFORTS, TO COUNTER THOSE VIOLENT ACTIONS, REGARDLESS OF WHICH GROUPS CARRY THEM OUT.

A PEASANT DEFENSE PATROL UNIT WAS COMBING THE AREA IN SEARCH OF GUERRILLAS WHEN IT WAS AMBUSHED ON 22 NOVEMBER, THE NEWSPAPER EXPRESO REPORTED TODAY.     THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE HAS HIT PERUVIAN TOURIST ESTABLISHMENTS IN THE CITY OF HUARAZ, CAPITAL OF THE ANCASH DEPARTMENT, WHERE FOUR INNS AND HOTELS WERE BOMBED LAST NIGHT, DAMAGING THE BUILDINGS AND INJURING AN 18 YEAR-OLD GIRL.     IN CUSCO, 1,000 KM SOUTHEAST OF LIMA, A BUS [AS RECEIVED] HEADING TOWARD MACHU PICHU WENT OUT OF CONTROL AS THE RESULT OF SABOTAGE AND FELL INTO A 60-METER RAVINE.

A TOTAL OF 227 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN URBAN VIOLENT ACTS.     SENATOR BERNALES ADDED THAT A TOTAL OF NEARLY 13,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE THE TERRORIST VIOLENCE BEGAN IN 1980.     BERNALES EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN OVER THE FACT THAT 67 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE KILLED IN VIOLENT ACTS INVOLVED YOUTHS WHO WERE BETWEEN 15 AND 29 YEARS OF AGE.

[VILLAGRAN] RIGHT NOW, THE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC COMMISSION, ON DIRECTIONS FROM THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND, IS MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO HUMANIZE THE WAR SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY BY SHOWING RESPECT FOR THE GENEVA AGREEMENT, WHICH GUATEMALA SIGNED.     WE ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE THE REPRESSIVE WAR THE ARMY HAS BEEN WAGING AGAINST THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT AND THE POPULATION HAS REACHED LEVELS OF EXTREME CRUELTY, INCLUDING INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AND THE USE OF DEFOLIANTS IN CONFLICT ZONES WHERE CIVILIANS LIVE.     THERE IS THE PARTICULAR SITUATION IN WHICH NEITHER THE GUATEMALAN ARMY NOR THE GOVERNMENT TAKE ANY WAR PRISONERS. THIS MAKES US BELIEVE THAT THE CRUELTY USED AGAINST CIVILIANS AND PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE ARMED CONFLICT IS A VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.     [MARTINEZ] DOES THE URNG HAVE ANY PRISONERS AT THIS MOMENT?     [VILLAGRAN] YES. WE HAVE SENT A NOTE TO THE NATIONAL RECONCILIATION COMMISSION SO IT CAN HANDLE THE CASE OF SOLDIER CARLOS PEREZ LOPEZ, WHO WAS CAPTURED WOUNDED IN THE SAN MARCOS REGION, NEAR GALVEZ. HE HAS BEEN GIVEN MUCH MEDICAL ATTENTION. NOW THAT HE HAS FULLY RECOVERED, WE ARE THINKING ABOUT PUBLICLY RETURNING THIS GUATEMALAN, AND WE ARE ASKING THE RECONCILIATION COMMISSION TO TAKE MEASURES THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS [IRC] TO RECEIVE THIS MAN IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE HUMANIZATION PROCESS.     [MARTINEZ] WILL THIS BE THE FIRST TIME THE URNG WILL MAKE THIS KIND OF CONTACT WITH THE IRC?     [VILLAGRAN] THE IRC HAS HAD LOCALIZATION PROBLEMS.  THERE HAS BEEN THE ARGUMENT THAT THERE IS A NATIONAL RED CROSS. CONTACT WITH THE IRC IS POSSIBLE IF THERE IS A PRESENCE OF THIS ORGANIZATION THAT FUNCTIONS BASED ON INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS. NOW THAT THE IRC IS PRESENT, THE WORK IS BEING FACILITATED.     THE CONTACT WITH THE IRC IS AT THE INITIATION LEVEL.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THESE CONTACTS WILL BE VERY USEFUL IN THE FUTURE, ESPECIALLY FOR PERSONS NOT INVOLVED IN THE ARMED CONFLICT.     [MARTINEZ] I THINK IT WOULD BE USEFUL IF WE CLOSE THIS INTERVIEW WITH YOU REPEATING THE NAME OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY SOLDIER WHO IS BEING HELD BY THE URNG AND WHOM THE GUERRILLA FORCES ARE PREPARED TO TURN OVER TO THE IRC.     [VILLAGRAN] YES. HIS NAME IS CARLOS LOPEZ PEREZ [AS HEARD].     [MARTINEZ] THANK YOU, VILLAGRAN.",

MEANWHILE, HIS BODYGUARD-CHAUFFEUR WAITED FOR HIM IN THE LOBBY. THE MAN WITH THE NEWSPAPERS, A CATTLEMAN NAMED GUSTAVO DE JESUS ESCOBAR FERNANDEZ, HAD JUST LEFT THE BOOKSTORE WHEN THE TROUBLE STARTED. ESCOBAR WAS PREPARING TO GO TO HIS CAR WHEN A MAN APPROACHED HIM.  THE MAN, AROUND 35 YEARS OLD AND 5 FEET 9 INCHES TALL, TOOK OUT A 7.65 CALIBER PISTOL AND BEGAN FIRING. PANIC SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE TERMINAL AS PEOPLE THREW THEMSELVES ON THE FLOOR TO AVOID BEING SHOT.     ESCOBAR IMMEDIATELY FELL TO THE FLOOR AS HIS ATTACKER TRIED TO ESCAPE THROUGH ONE OF THE EXITS. APPARENTLY, HE DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PRESENCE OF THE BODYGUARD, WHO HAD ENOUGH TIME TO DRAW HIS GUN AND SHOOT THE AGGRESSOR, WHO DIED AT THE SCENE. ESCOBAR FERNANDEZ WAS TAKEN TO THE SAN PEDRO CLAVER CLINIC, WHERE HE WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD ON ARRIVAL. BUT THE TRAGIC EVENT DID NOT END THERE. A 20-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WHO WAS AT THE AIRPORT, MARIA FLOREZ GUTIERREZ, WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED AND HER CONDITION WAS LISTED AS SERIOUS WHEN THIS EDITION WENT TO PRINT.     EARLY DETAILS DID NOT CLARIFY THE MOTIVATION FOR THE ATTACK. ACCORDING TO DOCUMENTS FOUND IN HIS CLOTHING, IN ADDITION TO HIS ACTIVITIES AS A CATTLEMAN, GUSTAVO DE JESUS ESCOBAR WAS A LEGAL ADVISOR IN CONGRESS, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS DENIED BY SPOKESMEN FROM THAT INSTITUTION. THINGS TOOK ANOTHER TURN THAT EVENING, WHEN THE TELEVISION NEWS PROGRAM 24 HOURS REPORTED THAT ESCOBAR FERNANDEZ WAS THE COUSIN OF PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA. THIS GAVE RISE TO THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE ATTACK WAS LINKED TO THE SERIES OF KILLINGS IN THE SO-CALLED \"CARTEL WAR.\"     AS TO THE ATTACKER, NEITHER HIS REAL MOTIVES NOR HIS IDENTITY WERE KNOWN AT THE END OF THE WEEK.

THERE HAS BEEN TALK ABOUT THAT IN RECENT DAYS. ALL INDICATIONS ARE, INDEED, THAT BECAUSE TIME IS RUNNING SHORT THEY WILL START UP WITHOUT MUCH CIRCUMSPECTION. TO PUT IT MORE CLEARLY, THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT THEY WILL WAIT UNTIL THINGS ARE UNDER WAY BEFORE TRYING TO PUT THEIR OWN MARK ON THE NEWBORN.     CHRISTIAN LEFT [IC] WAS THE FIRST TO GIVE THIS SIGNAL. THE RESOLUTIONS OF ITS PLENUM, MADE PUBLIC ON 28 OCTOBER, CLEARLY REVEALED THAT IT INTENDED TO UNIFY THE ENTIRE LEFT IN THE FORMATION OF THE NEW POLITICAL ENTITY. IN PASSING, THEY SENT A MESSAGE TO THEIR MEN WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE PPD [PARTY FOR DEMOCRACY]: THEY HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN MEMBERSHIP IN ONE OR THE OTHER, BUT NOT BOTH.  THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MAPU [UNITED POPULAR ACTION MOVEMENT]-BARRUETO IS NOT ADDRESSING WITH THE SAME EARNESTNESS. THEY APPARENTLY SEEK TO TAKE PART IN EVERY GROUP THERE IS, WHETHER IT IS CALLED THE PPD, COSONO [SOCIALIST COMMAND FOR THE NO] OR LEFTIST PARTY.     THE CHRISTIAN LEFT PEOPLE WENT EVEN FURTHER. AT NO TIME DID THEY CONCEAL THEIR WISH THAT LUIS MAIRA PRESIDE OVER THE NEW PARTY.     THE PLENUM OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY [PS]-ALMEYDA WAS, OF COURSE, THE MOST EAGERLY ANTICIPATED. AS ON OTHER OCCASIONS, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO SET THE TONE FOR THE JOCKEYING BY THE LEFT. THEY AMBITIOUSLY FELT THAT THIS WAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE SOME STRATEGIC OBSTACLES, SORT OF LIKE KILLING TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE: REGISTRATION AND THE SOUGHT-AFTER SOCIALIST UNITY.     PERHAPS THIS IS WHY THEY HELD THEIR PLENUM, WHERE ON 28 AND 29 OCTOBER THEY DISCUSSED THE ADVANTAGES OF REGISTERING THEIR OWN PARTY, IN OTHER WORDS, RESPONDING ONCE AND FOR ALL TO THE INITIATIVES OF THE NUNEZES, WHO TOOK OVER THE PPD, THE ONLY LEGALLY RECOGNIZED SOCIALIST GROUP.  OTHERS THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE WISER TO PROMOTE A PARTY IN THE \"SOCIALIST SPACE,\" BRING TOGETHER THERE CHRISTIAN LEFT, MAPU-BARRUETO AND THE SMALL SOCIALIST GROUPS THAT STILL EXIST, IN OTHER WORDS, COSONO AS A PARTY. THIS STAND OBVIOUSLY GAVE PRIORITY TO SOMETHING OF A LEADING POLITICAL ROLE AND KEPT THE PC AT A DISTANCE.     THE OPTION OF REGISTERING A BROAD LEFT-WING GROUP WAS ALSO RAISED AT THE PLENUM; TO MANY THIS ENTAILED A CERTAIN \"SACRIFICE\" OF PREDOMINANCE BY THE SOCIALISTS.     THE PS-ALMEYDA ULTIMATELY OPTED FOR A \"CONSENSUS\" VOTE, OF WHOSE PUBLIC VERSION THERE WERE SEVERAL INTERPRETATIONS.  THERE WAS TALK OF \"THE REGISTRATION OF A LEGAL INSTRUMENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SOCIALIST SPACE AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE GRASSROOTS FORCES AND OF THE PROGRESSIVE AND LEFTIST INDEPENDENTS WHO HAVE SO FAR BELONGED TO UNLEGALIZED PARTIES.\" THE INTENTION OF THE SOCIALIST LANGUAGE WAS CLEAR, BUT THE PARTY DID NOT CLOSE RANKS WITH A BROAD LEFT-WING ALLIANCE. THE EMPHASIS WAS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER.     WHAT WAS NOT MADE PUBLIC WAS THAT THE POLITICAL VOTE OF \"THE MORE THAN 50 AND FEWER THAN 100 PARTICIPANTS\" SPOKE OF GIVING PRIORITY TO SOCIALIST LEADERSHIP IN THE NEW PARTY. THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOW FOCUSING ON THIS. [CONTINUED]",

ALL COLOMBIANS, INCLUDING ILLUSTRIOUS FORMER PRESIDENTS, THE MEDIA, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, POLITICAL PARTIES, THE REBELS, AND THE NATION AT LARGE, HAVE BEEN VOICING THEIR STRONG DESIRE FOR RECONCILIATION IN THE HOMELAND.     WE REBELS HAVE ALWAYS REGARDED PEACE HIGHLY. THIS IS WHY WE HAVE ALWAYS CLEARLY REITERATED THIS IDEA. TO SET THE PROPER FRAME OF MIND, WE WILL RECALL WHAT WAS SAID IN THE LA URIBE AGREEMENT ON 28 MARCH 1984:     \"TO ENSURE PEACE IN THE NATION--WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITE FOR THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE'S PROSPERITY--AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BASED ON LIBERTY AND JUSTICE, THE FOLLOWING IS HEREBY AGREED UPON.     \"1. THE FARC AND EP [POOR PEOPLE'S ARMY] WILL ORDER A CEASE-FIRE AND THE SUSPENSION OF ALL MILITARY OPERATIONS IN ALL FRONTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AS OF 0000 ON 28 MAY 1984.     \"2. THE FARC AND EP WILL AGAIN CONDEMN AND NOT ALLOW KIDNAPPINGS, EXTORTION, AND TERRORISM IN ALL THEIR FORMS.  FARC-EP WILL HELP ELIMINATE THESE PRACTICES BECAUSE THEY ARE AN ATTACK ON LIBERTY AND HUMAN DIGNITY.\"     IN ADDITION, THE M-19 AND EPL [PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY] REACHED THE FOLLOWING AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT: \"... WE BELIEVE THE CESSATION OF ARMED CLASHES BETWEEN GOVERNMENT FORCES AND THE REBELS IS AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL REFORMS THAT THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE NEED AND DESIRE. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE HIGHEST INTERESTS OF THE HOMELAND, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS HAVE REACHED THE FOLLOWING AGREEMENT: THE NEGOTIATION AND DIALOGUE COMMISSION, THE EPL GENERAL COMMAND, AND THE M-19 HIGH COMMAND HAVE AGREED ON A CEASE-FIRE. ONCE THIS IS CARRIED OUT, A GREAT NATIONAL DIALOGUE WILL BEGIN, DEVELOP, AND CONCLUDE. THROUGH THIS DIALOGUE, ALL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SECTORS WILL BE ABLE TO EXPRESS THEIR WILLINGNESS TO SEARCH FOR PEACE BASED ON SOCIAL JUSTICE.     \"CONSEQUENTLY, THE EPL GENERAL COMMAND AND THE M-19 HIGH COMMAND HEREBY ORDER ALL FRONTS, COLUMNS, AND UNITS TO CEASE FIRING AND SUSPEND ALL MILITARY OPERATIONS AS OF 1300 ON 30 AUGUST.\"     THE SPIRIT AND THE LETTER OF THESE ACCORDS IS NOW WORTH CONSIDERING. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN COLOMBIANS SAID THESE ACCORDS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REBELS HAD BECOME THE COUNTRY'S NEW POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY.     THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR USELESS RECRIMINATIONS, BUT FOR A SERIOUS EFFORT TO DETERMINE WHO IS TO BLAME BECAUSE THE ACCORDS WENT PARTIALLY UNFULFILLED. ANYWAY, CONSIDERING THESE ACCORDS WILL NOT HARM THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICY. WE HEREBY REAFFIRM OUR WILLINGNESS TO TALK WITH YOUR GOVERNMENT TO FIND A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE COUNTRY'S PROBLEMS.  THIS WILLINGNESS TO TALK IS SHARED BY ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SIMON BOLIVAR GUERRILLA COORDINATING BOARD AND IS PART OF THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY THREE GUERRILLA SUMMIT MEETINGS.     WE FULLY AGREE WITH THE PEACE PROPOSAL PRESENTED BY SENATOR ALBERTO LEYVA DURAN. WE FIND IT CLEAR, SIMPLE, UNDERSTANDABLE, AND COMPLETE. THIS IS WHY WE WROTE THIS LETTER, MADE OUR LATEST STATEMENTS, AND HAVE GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS FOR A UNILATERAL CEASE-FIRE AS THE BEST CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR OUR PEOPLE.

THE APRA CONGRESS ELIMINATED THE POST OF PARTY PRESIDENT, WHICH WAS CREATED FOR ALAN GARCIA IN 1985, CONSOLIDATING HIS POSITION AS PARTY LEADER FOLLOWING A DECISIVE VICTORY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF THAT YEAR.     ACCORDING TO SOME CRITICS WITHIN THE PARTY, THE PERSONALISM THAT HAD CHARACTERIZED GARCIA'S UNDISPUTED LEADERSHIP SINCE 1982 WAS THUS ENDED.     LUIS ALVA CASTRO, 46, FORMER PRIME MINISTER AND ECONOMY MINISTER AS WELL AS FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, WAS ELECTED BY A LARGE MARGIN AS THE NEW SECRETARY GENERAL, A POST WHICH REGAINED THE HIGHEST STATUS IN THE PARTY. ALVA CASTRO CAPITALIZED ON THE INTERNAL DISSIDENCE AND ON THE PARTY'S DISENCHANTMENT WITH ALAN GARCIA AS A RESULT OF THE DETERIORATION OF THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION, WHICH IS CONSIDERED THE WORST CRISIS IN THIS CENTURY AND IS BLAMED ON THE CHIEF OF STATE'S \"STUBBORNNESS\" IN NOT CHANGING HIS NATIONALISTIC AND POPULIST POLICY LINE.\"     THE NEW CADRE ELECTED AT THE 16TH APRA CONGRESS IS IN FAVOR OF A \"CHANGE IN ORIENTATION\" IN THE PARTY'S MANAGEMENT AND IN THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION FOR THE REMAINING 18 MONTHS OF THE APRA'S TERM IN OFFICE. IT IS EXPECTED THAT ALAN GARCIA AND ALVA CASTRO MAY REACH AN AGREEMENT ON THE WAY THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE RUN UNTIL 1990, WHEN THE CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL TERM WILL END FOLLOWING NEW GENERAL ELECTIONS.     GARCIA ALSO LOST THE PRESIDENCY OF THE POLITICAL COMMISSION THAT SETS THE PARTY'S POLITICAL LINE. THIS POST WAS WON BY LUIS ALBERTO SANCHEZ, 88, FIRST VICE PRESIDENT OF THE NATION AND ONE OF THE MAINSPRINGS IN THE CHANGEOVER OPERATION WITHIN THE APRA.     THE OTHER ELECTIVE POSITIONS WERE FILLED WITH APRA MEMBERS WHO DO NOT FOLLOW GARCIA'S LINE. THUS, THE PRESENCE OF ALAN GARCIA WITHIN THE PARTY WAS REDUCED TO BEING MEMBER OF THE POLITICAL COMMISSION IN HIS CAPACITY AS FORMER PARTY SECRETARY GENERAL.     TWO DAYS AGO, THE PERUVIAN CHIEF OF STATE RESIGNED THE APRA PRESIDENCY, UPSET OVER CRITICISM DIRECTED AT HIM DURING THE OPENING OF THE PARTY CONGRESS. HE THUS RESPONDED TO OBVIOUS SIGNS THAT THE PARTY PRESIDENT POST WOULD BE ELIMINATED.     THE APRA HAD THOUGHT ALAN GARCIA WOULD BE A VERY CAPABLE HEIR TO VICTOR RAUL HAYA DE LA TORRE, THE PARTY'S FOUNDER AND HISTORICAL LEADER, WHO DIED IN 1979. THREE AND ONE-HALF YEARS AFTER GARCIA'S ELECTION VICTORY, THE PARTY DISQUALIFIED GARCIA FOR THE ROLE OF HAYA DE LA TORRE'S SUCCESSOR BECAUSE OF HIS ERRORS AND HIS FAILURE TO RECTIFY HIS GOVERNMENT LINE.     FOLLOWING THE TRADITION INITIATED BY ALAN GARCIA, NEW APRA LEADER LUIS ALVA CASTRO WILL BE SWORN IN AS SECRETARY GENERAL THIS COMING FRIDAY BEFORE THE TOMB OF HAYA DE LA TORRE IN THE NORTHERN CITY OF TRUJILLO, THE APRA'S MAIN BASTION.     THE ECONOMIC CRISIS, MARKED BY 2,000-PERCENT INFLATION AND A 20-PERCENT RECESSION FROM OCTOBER 1987 TO OCTOBER 1988, IS COMPOUNDED BY SOCIAL INSTABILITY AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE, WITH KILLINGS AVERAGING FOUR PER DAY.     AN INTERNAL POLITICAL STORM HIT THE APRA 16TH NATIONAL CONGRESS, AND VICE PRESIDENT SANCHEZ SAID THAT HE CANNOT RECALL ANYTHING SIMILAR.     DURING THE LAST SESSION OF THE CONGRESS, THREE YOUTHS WERE INJURED IN A MELEE AMONG APRA PEOPLE. OTHER PARTY MEMBERS WERE HIT ON THE HEAD WITH HANDGUN BUTTS, AND THREE NEWSMEN--WHO HAD NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO ATTEND THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONGRESS--WERE ATTACKED.",
