ATTENTION: THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT HAS SUSPENDED ITS AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.     SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTER LUIS YANEZ [AS HEARD] REPORTED TODAY THAT SPAIN HAS SUSPENDED AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT UNTIL THE KILLINGS OF THE SPANISH JESUITS, WHO HAD BEEN LIVING IN OUR COUNTRY FOR YEARS, ARE RESOLVED.     THIS REPORT REPRESENTS A SERIOUS POLITICAL SETBACK FOR THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.  THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S DECISION FURTHER ISOLATES THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WHICH IS ALREADY UNDER PRESSURE BECAUSE OF CALLS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SUSPENSION OF MILITARY AID.  THIS SUSPENSION REPRESENTS A HALT IN THE DELIVERY OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT TO SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.     THIS REPRESENTS INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.  THE INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION OF THE CRISTIANI REGIME IS GROWING.",

NO ONE WAS INJURED.     A FLAG FROM THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT (FPMR) WAS FOUND AT THE SCENE OF THE EXPLOSION.  THE FPMR IS A CLANDESTINE LEFTIST GROUP THAT PROMOTES \"ALL FORMS OF STRUGGLE\" AGAINST THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT HEADED BY GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET.     POLICE SOURCES HAVE REPORTED THAT THE EXPLOSION CAUSED SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE SALVADORAN EMBASSY BUILDING AND TO NEARBY STRUCTURES IN THE ELEGANT PROVIDENCIA NEIGHORHOOD IN EASTERN SANTIAGO.     THE GOVERNMENT CHARGES THAT THE FPMR, WHICH ON 14 DECEMBER WILL MARK 6 YEARS OF SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY, IS THE \"ARMED BRANCH\" OF THE OUTLAWED COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHILE.  AS OF MIDNIGHT TONIGHT THE CARABINEROS AND POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICE AGENTS WERE CARRYING OUT AN INTENSIVE OPERATION TO ARREST THOSE RESPONISBLE FOR THE ATTACK.",

SHE HAS DESCRIBED U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CASOLO AS AN ERP [PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY] MEMBER IN CHARGE OF LOGISTICS.     AS HAS BEEN REPORTED, CASOLO WAS RELEASED BY A MILITARY JUDGE AFTER HE DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE AGAINST HER.  SOME GROUPS, HOWEVER, ASSERT THAT CASOLO WAS RELEASED DUE TO POLITICAL PRESSURE FROM THE UNITED STATES, WHICH THREATENED TO LAUNCH A WORLDWIDE CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT EL SALVADOR IF CASOLO WAS NOT RELEASED.     AGUILAR MARROQUIN WAS ARRESTED AT 1500 ON 9 DECEMBER AFTER HAVING PARTICIPATED IN AN ATTACK ON AN URBAN PUBLIC BUS NEAR JUAN PABLO II BOULEVARD.     THE WOMAN FLED AND SOUGHT REFUGE INSIDE THE FACILITIES OF THE SALVADORAN ALBERTO MASFERRER UNIVERSITY, WHERE SHE TOOK A GROUP OF STUDENTS AS HOSTAGES, THREATENING THEM WITH HAND GRENADES. THE POLICE PREVENTED HER FROM DOING ANYTHING AND ARRESTED HER, CONFISCATING ONE .45-CALIBER PISTOL, BULLETS, CARTRIDGES, AND TWO FRAGMENTATION GRENADES.     AGUILAR MARROQUIN SAID THAT SHE JOINED THE ERP LAST MARCH AND THAT SHE WAS PART OF AN URBAN COMMANDO CALLED WORKERS JUSTICE COMMAND. AGUILAR ADDED THAT SHE KNOWS U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CASOLO, WHO BELONGS TO THE ERP, AND THAT CASOLO USED TO MEET WITH TERRORIST LEADER FERNANDO, WORKERS JUSTICE COMMAND OPERATIONS CHIEF, NEAR THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY (UES).     AGUILAR ADDED THAT CASOLO WAS IN CHARGE OF ERP LOGISTICS, ESPECIALLY LODGING PEOPLE AND TRANSPORTING ARMS AND WAR EQUIPMENT. THE ERP HAD GIVEN HER TWO MINIBUSES FOR HER TO CARRY OUT HER TASKS.     IN ADDITION, AGUILAR SAID THAT SHE BELIEVES CASOLO HAD A LEADING POSITION WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION, BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO MEETING WITH FERNANDO, SHE ALSO MET WITH AN INDIVIDUAL KNOWN AS MINCHO, WHO IS THE POLITICAL-MILITARY ERP METROPOLITAN CHIEF AND ALSO THE CHIEF OF THE SO-CALLED URBAN COMMANDOS.     THE PRISONER KNEW ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE ARMS IN CASOLO'S HOUSE, BECAUSE ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS AGUILAR'S CHIEF, KNOWN AS MIRIAM, TOLD HER ABOUT IT. OTHER TERRORISTS WENT TO CASOLO'S HOUSE TO GET WEAPONS, AMMUNITION, AND EXPLOSIVES TO CONDUCT THEIR SABOTAGE OPERATIONS AGAINST BUSES, TELEPHONE DISTRIBUTION BOXES, POWER PYLONS, OR TO CONDUCT LARGE OPERATIONS--AS AGUILAR DESCRIBED THEM-- SUCH AS ATTACKS ON MILITARY GARRISONS.     ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION OBTAINED, THE PRISONER WILL BE SENT TO COURT OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.",

THE POLICE REPORTED THAT THE EXPLOSION CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO ALL BUILDINGS ON THE BLOCK.     THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED AT 2130 (0130 GMT) ON THURSDAY [AS RECEIVED].  IT DAMAGED WINDOWS OF THE BUILDINGS ON THE BLOCK.     JOSE PARADA GRANDY, THE BOLIVIAN POLICE CHIEF, TOLD EFE THAT AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSON STEPPED OUT OF A VEHICLE AND PLACED A PACKAGE IN ONE OF THE PLANT POTS ON JUAN DE LA RIVA STREET, A FEW METERS FROM THE U.S. EMBASSY IN DOWNTOWN LA PAZ.     PARADA SAID: \"THE VEHICLE LEFT AND IMMEDIATELY THE CHARGE WENT OFF CAUSING CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE.\"     THE \"ZARATE WILLKA ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION,\" A GROUP WITH AN INDIAN BAKCGROUND, HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK IN A COMMUNIQUE THAT WAS SENT TO SOME MEDIA.     THE NOTE, SIGNED WITH THE INITIALS OF THE \"ZARATE WILLKA\" GROUP, STATES: \"IN DEFENSE OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE. DEATH TO THE INVADER. OUR HATRED IS RELENTLESS; OUR WAR IS TO DEATH.\"     THE \"ZARATE WILLKA\" GROUP CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY IN AUGUST 1988 FOR THE ATTACK AGAINST THEN U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE GEORGE SHULTZ AND THE KILLING OF TWO MORMON MISSIONARIES.

AFTER THE EXPLOSION, A GROUP OF U.S. AGENTS CALLED OFF AN INVESTIGATION AT THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE SHOUTED AT THEM, \"YANKEES, OUT OF PANAMA.\"     THE U.S. EMBASSY PRESS ATTACHE, BRUCE WARTON, SAID TODAY THAT \"IT IS OBVIOUSLY A DESPICABLE ACTION THAT DOES MORE HARM TO BOLIVIANS THAN TO THE U.S. EMBASSY, BECAUSE WE HAVE SUFFERED NO DAMAGES.\"",

    "doctext": "SANTIAGO, 20 MAR 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [CHILEAN PRESIDENT AUGUSTO PINOCHET] [TEXT] FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: I AM ADDRESSING YOU AFTER OUR COUNTRY HAS BEGUN TO OVERCOME, WITH EFFORT AND TENACITY, THE FIRST OBSTACLES OF A SERIOUS CRISIS, THE FUTURE IMPLICATIONS AND REPERCUSSIONS OF WHICH WE STILL DO NOT KNOW. I THEREFORE WANTED TO CONVEY A MESSAGE OF HOPE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO EVERY CHILEAN, TO SHOW THEM MY FEELINGS AT THIS TIME OF DEEP REFLECTION.     FROM THE VERY MOMENT I LEARNED ABOUT THIS TERRORIST ECONOMIC AGGRESSION, I ORDERED THE CREATION OF FOUR MINISTERIAL COMMISSIONS TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM. I ALSO SENT TWO MINISTERS TO THE UNITED STATES TO MEET WITH U.S.  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. AFTER TIRING SESSIONS OF TALKS, THESE MINISTERS MANAGED TO OVERCOME A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE GRAPE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM AFFECTING OTHER FRUITS REMAINS TO BE SOLVED.     THIS NEW ATTACK AGAINST THE CHILEAN NATION, AN ATTACK THAT DESTINY HAS PLACED IN THE NATION'S PATH OF FREEDOM, PROGRESS, AND WELL-BEING, COMPELS US TO CLOSE RANKS BEHIND THE GOVERNMENT, UNIFIED AND READY TO FIGHT -- WITH COURAGE AND HIGH SPIRIT -- THE PROBLEM THAT FACES US.     ON THIS OCCASION THE COUNTRY HAS SEEN HOW THE COUNTLESS THREATS TO BOYCOTT THE NATIONAL ECONOMY HAVE WORKED. MOST OF THE TIME SUCH THREATS HAVE BEEN PROMOTED BY CERTAIN POLITICIANS, LABOR LEADERS, OR COMMUNIST LABOR UNIONS, BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO -- DRIVEN BY PERSONAL OR IDEOLOGICAL INTEREST -- HAVE CONTINUALLY JEOPARDIZED THE STABILITY OF WORKERS, OF FAMILIES, AND OF THOSE WHOM THEY DEMAGOGICALLY CALL THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN. THEY DO NOT CARE IF THEY CAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT, POVERTY, AND HUNGER TO 500,000 FELLOW CITIZENS WHO WORK IN THIS AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY.     HOW SHAMELESSLY THEY MAKE CLAIMS AND DEMANDS, OFFERING THEIR SUPPORT AND THEIR SOLIDARITY WHEN CHILE IS SERIOUSLY THREATENED! YET WHEN THE DANGER IS OVER, THEY CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE AND AGAIN LEVEL CHARGES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND CRITICIZE ITS ACTIONS. IN DOING THAT THEY FAIL TO RECALL THAT FROM ITS VERY BEGINNING THE CHILEAN NATION HAS BEEN BUILT UPON NON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ESSENCE OF THE NATIONAL SOUL.     GENTLEMEN: OUR WILL IS BASED ON OUR FEELING OF UNITY IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY, WHETHER FROM THE ACTION OF NATURE OR FROM THE ACTION OF TREACHEROUS, DISTURBED MINDS THAT RECOGNIZE NO MORAL VALUES, FATHERLAND, OR LAW.     CHILEANS: A FEW DAYS AGO I REPORTED ON THE STEPS FORWARD IN THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION PROCESS AND ON THE PROGRESS THAT OUR COUNTRY HAS MADE IN ALL FIELDS.     THE FACT THAT CYANIDE HAS BEEN INJECTED INTO TWO EXPORTED GRAPES HAS CAUSED INCALCULABLE DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY; IT HAS ALSO BROUGHT THE SHADOW OF ANGUISH AND UNCERTAINTY TO THOUSANDS OF HOMES OF FELLOW COUNTRYMEN WHOSE JOBS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO A LIVELIHOOD HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY JEOPARDIZED. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT SOME OFFICIALS OF IMPORTING COUNTRIES, WITHOUT WEIGHING THE TRUE EFFECTS OF THIS TYPE OF MEASURE, HAVE RESTRICTED THE IMPORT OF CHILEAN FRUITS, THUS PROVOKING FEAR AND DISTRUST ON THE INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER MARKET. GENTLEMEN, WE MUST REVERSE THIS SITUATION.     WE SHOULD ONCE AGAIN ACT IN A UNITED MANNER TO RECOVER INTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE AND OUR UNDISPUTED LEADERSHIP AS EXPORTERS. I AM SURE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED WITH A NEW JOINT EFFORT. [CONTINUED]",
