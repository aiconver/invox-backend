OUR REPORTER HERNANDO CORRALES HAS THE DETAILS:     [BEGIN RECORDING] [CORRALES] IF THE AUTHORITIES IN CHARGE OF AN OPERATION NEAR PUERTO BOYACA ON 18 JULY LAST YEAR HAD NOT SABOTAGED IT, THE FOREIGN INSTRUCTORS AT THE SERVICE OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL WOULD NOW BE JAIL.  ON THAT DATE, MARTA LUCIA GONZALEZ, SECOND JUDGE OF PUBLIC ORDER, WROTE A FILE NOTE SAYING THAT THE JUDICIAL INSPECTION WAS UNJUSTLY TORPEDOED WITH THE ARGUMENT THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN FOUND AND THAT THIS ARGUMENT WAS SENSELESS AND ILLOGICAL SINCE ABSOLUTELY NO ONE OTHER THAN THE UNDERSIGNED JUDGE COULD DECIDE IF HE OR SHE HAD ANYTHING TO INSPECT, OR IF HE OR SHE SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT CONDUCT THE JUDICIAL PROCEEDING.     THE DOCUMENT, WHICH IS CONTAINED IN THE DOSSIER ON THE MASSACRE IN LA HONDURA AND LA NEGRA, URABA REGION, SAYS THAT SHE WAS LEFT 2 DAYS INSIDE A PLANE AT THE AIRPORT OF THE TEXAS PETROLEUM COMPANY IN PUERTO BOYACA AND THAT THE POLICE AUTHORITIES ACCOMPANYING HER FAILED TO EXPLAIN TO HER WHY THEY HAD NOT TAKEN ANY ACTION.     [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] IN FACT, SHE AND SEVERAL DAS INSPECTORS ENCOUNTERED SOME OBSTACLES.  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WAS INFORMED OF THESE OBSTACLES IN ORDER FOR IT TO MAKE AN INVESTIGATION. I THINK THAT WHEN SHE AND THE DAS PERSONNEL WERE PREPARING TO GO TO PUERTO BOYACA IT WAS ALREADY KNOWN THAT THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE PRESENT THERE FOR THESE PROCEEDINGS AND THIS WAS QUITE WORRISOME.     [CORRALES] AS IS KNOWN, JUDGE GONZALEZ HAD TO LEAVE COLOMBIA BECAUSE HER LIFE WAS THREATENED, AND HER FATHER, FORMER BOYACA GOVERNOR ALVARO GONZALEZ SANTANA, WAS SUBSEQUENTLY MURDERED.

[MAZA] WE ARE TAKING ACTION THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE COUNTRY. WE ARE NOT SHOWING ANY SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS BECAUSE WE INTEND TO ACT INDISCRIMINATELY.  WHAT WE WANT IS TO FIGHT A SCOURGE THAT HAS GREATLY HARMED ALL COLOMBIANS.

THE MASSACRE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION [FENASTRAS] WAS PLANNED IN COLD BLOOD.  THE SITE AND THE MOMENT WHEN THE FENASTRAS LEADERS WERE MEETING HAD BEEN SELECTED.     2.  WE HAVE TRUSTWORTHY INFORMATION FROM OUR INTELLIGENCE ORGANS THAT THIS ACTION WAS ORDERED BY COLONEL PONCE, THAT CRISTIANI KNEW ABOUT IT AND APPROVED IT, AND THAT IT WAS CARRIED OUT BY COLONEL ELENA FUENTE AS THE HEAD OF THE MORBID DEATH SQUAD OF THE ARMY'S 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IN RESPONSE TO OUR MILITARY ATTACK ON THE ARMY STAFF.  THIS BEHAVIOR BY CRISTIANI SHOULD SURPRISE NO ONE.  TERRORISM IS AN OLD PRACTICE OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA].     ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO, ARENA ASSASSINS TRIED TO KILL THE PRESIDENT OF THE MORTGAGE BANK, MR MASON, FOR NOT FOLLOWING THEIR ORDERS.     3.  THE PEOPLE DEMAND THE RESIGNATION OF CHIEF OF STAFF COL EMILIO PONCE BECAUSE HIS RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS CRIMINAL ACTION IS REAL.     4.  THE FMLN HAS PRUDENTLY TAKEN TIME BEFORE ADOPTING A DEFINITE POSITION.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ADOPTED AN IRRESPONSIBLE ATTITUDE AND HAVE BRAZENLY ACCUSED THE FMLN OF THE CRIMES THEY COMMIT.     IN VIEW OF THIS ATTITUDE AND OF THE PEOPLE'S INDIGNATION, WE HAVE TO PREVENT OUR PRESENCE AT THE DIALOGUE FROM BEING USED TO COVER UP THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS MASSACRE AND TO ENHANCE THE MASK OF MODERATOR AND NEGOTIATOR THAT CRISTIANI HAS BEEN USING TO SECURE POLITICAL SUPPORT AND U.S. FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO EXTEND THE WAR.     IN SAN JOSE, SPEAKING ON ITS VIEW OF THE WAR, THE GOVERNMENT SAID THAT IT CONSIDERS POPULAR MOVEMENTS AS SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS OF THE FMLN, AND THEREFORE, AS ENEMIES OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THE ARMED CONFLICT.     WE DEMANDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION GIVE US A LIST OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS, BUT TO NO AVAIL.  THE TERRORIST ATTACKS AND MASSACRES ARE NOW YIELDING THE LISTS THAT WERE DENIED TO US AT THE DIALOGUE TABLE.     EVEN BEFORE THE SAN JOSE MEETING, THE GOVERNMENT HAD GREATLY INCREASED ITS REPRESSION.  SINCE THE MEETING, IT HAS INCREASED ITS DETENTIONS AND ATTACKED THE RESIDENCES OF LEADERS OF THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT AND THE UDN [NATIONALIST DEMOCRATIC UNION], UNIVERSITY, FECMASAN [MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO FEDERATION OF COMMITTEES OF MOTHERS AND RELATIVES], AND FENASTRAS.  MEANWHILE, CRISTIANI IS MAINTAINING HIS HYPOCRITICAL POSITION OF MODERATION.     THE MASSACRES, DETENTIONS, AND REPRESSION OF EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS, THE REPATRIATED, UNIVERSITIES, LABOR UNIONS, PEASANT COOPERATIVES, MOTHERS' ORGANIZATIONS, AND OTHER SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION SHOW THAT THE WAR OF THE ARMED FORCES, GOVERNMENT, AND ARENA IS AIMED AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND, THEREFORE, THESE GROUPS CANNOT AND WILL NOT REMAIN IDLE.     THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE UP ARMS AND EXERCISE THEIR LEGITIMATE DEFENSE.  THE ARMED PEOPLE'S AND REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE HEADED BY THE FMLN IS JUST, LEGITIMATE, AND NECESSARY.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] TWO-FACED CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, THE FMLN HAS DECIDED TO IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THE DIALOGUE OBSERVERS AND THE CHURCH, WHICH IS THE MEDIATOR, TO DEMAND THROUGH THEM GUARANTEES FOR OPPOSITION CIVIC AND LABOR GROUPS AND A REVIEW OF THE CURRENT CONDITIONS OF THE DIALOGUE, NEGOTIATION PROCESS, AND ITS PROSPECTS.  MEANWHILE, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO SUSPEND OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE CARACAS MEETING.

COPREFA ALSO REPORTS THAT MILITARY ACTIONS HAVE OCCURRED IN CABANAS, LA LIBERTAD, CHALATENANGO, SANTA ANA, LA LIBERTAD, AND SAN SALVADOR DEPARTMENTS DURING THE PAST TWO DAYS.  IN SOME PLACES THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS WERE SABOTAGED, CAUSING LONG BLACKOUTS.     THE GUERRILLA FORCES' GENERAL COMMAND ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE IN SAN SALVADOR ON 2 MAY, STATING THAT THE MILITARY ACTIONS ARE IN RESPONSE TO \"THE TRIUMPHANT AND ARROGANT ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY, FOR THE FMLN'S ALLEGED WEAKNESS, WHICH PRECLUDES THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS.\"     THE COMMUNIQUE REASSERTS THEIR WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS WITH THE GOVERNMENT TO END A WAR WHICH HAS LASTED MORE THAN A DECADE.  THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS IS BEING UNDERTAKEN WITH THE MEDIATION OF UN SECRETARY GENERAL JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR.     PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S SPECIAL ENVOY, ALVARO DE SOTO, ARRIVED IN SAN SALVADOR ON 2 MAY AS PART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS.  HE MET WITH PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE COMMISSION TODAY, AND LATER HE WILL MEET WITH OTHER LEADERS.     GUILLERMO UNGO, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR), TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT OPPOSITION LEADERS COULD \"POSSIBLY\" MEET WITH FMLN DELEGATES IN MEXICO CITY TO LEARN THEIR VIEWS CONCERNING THE NEGOTIATIONS.     \"THE MEETING WILL HAVE AN OPEN AGENDA SO THAT EVERYONE'S POSITION CAN BE HEARD AND SO THAT THE ROLE OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATIONS CAN BE DETERMINED,\" UNGO SAID.",

HE ALSO CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT IN BRUSSELS THIS WEEK BY FPMR INTERNATIONAL SPOKESMAN MARCELO REYES.     DIAZ CARO, WHO HAS CONFESSED TO BEING ONE OF THE SNIPERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ATTACK ON PRESIDENT AUGUSTO PINOCHET, IS CURRENTLY UNDER ARREST IN THE SANTIAGO PRISON, AND, TOGETHER WITH VASILY CARILLO NOVA, HE IS NATIONAL SPOKESMAN FOR ONE OF THE FACTIONS OF THIS EXTREMIST ORGANIZATION.     DIAZ CARO, WHO WAS ARRESTED IN LATE 1986 BY THE POLICE, ANNOUNCED THAT IN \"A MATTER OF HOURS\" THEY WILL START SUBVERSIVE ACTIONS. HE EXPLAINED THAT THIS NEW PHASE OF ARMED STRUGGLE WILL BE CARRIED OUT \"FROM ARICA DOWN TO MAGALLANES.\"     AT THE SAME TIME HE REFERRED TO THE RESULTS OF THE PLEBISCITE, STATING THAT ALTHOUGH THEY RESPECT THOSE WHO VOTED \"NO,\" \"THE ONLY ASPECT OF THE VICTORY OF THE `NO' WE ACCEPT IS THAT PINOCHET LEAVE POWER.\"     IN REFERRING TO THE FPMR'S CHANGE OF STRATEGY, DIAZ CARO DISCLOSED THAT THE DECISION WAS MADE DURING A MEETING OF THE ORGANIZATION'S LEADERS LAST APRIL.     OF THIS OCCASION THEY DISCUSSED THE LINE THAT THE TERRORIST ORGANIZATION SHOULD FOLLOW. THEY ALSO DECIDED TO GIVE UP THE IDEA OF AN \"ARMED REBELLION,\" WHICH PREVAILED UNTIL THEN. THE MAIN CHARACTERISTIC OF THAT IDEA WAS THAT THE ORGANIZATION SERVED TO COMPLEMENT CLASS STRUGGLE (AS IT DID IN ITS ORIGIN IN 1983), TO SUPPORT THE PEOPLE'S REBELLION TO PARALYZE THE COUNTRY AND TO PERPETRATE ATTACKS AGAINST THE ESTABLISHED REGIME.     DIAZ CARO DISCLOSED THAT DURING THE MEETING THEY DECIDED TO REPLACE THE REBELLION WITH THE SEARCH FOR A PATRIOTIC UNITY GOVERNMENT. HE SAID THAT \"WE REALIZE THAT OUSTING THE REGIME IS SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATIONS UNDER A PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT.\"     ACCORDING TO DIAZ CARO THIS IS WHEN THEY REALIZED THE \"NEED FOR A `TRUCE' BECAUSE THEY NEEDED TO PLAN GREATER STEPS.\"     HE ADDED THAT \"THIS IS WHEN WHAT WE CALL THE `NATIONAL PATRIOTIC WAR' SURFACED. THE MAIN ISSUE OF THIS WAR IS THE ARMED STRUGGLE; WE ARE NO LONGER A MERE COMPLEMENT TO THE PEOPLE. IT REPRESENTS A QUALITATIVE STEP FORWARD AND ENTAILS GREATER RESPONSIBILITIES.\"     DIAZ CARO DISCLOSED THAT THIS NEW PHASE WILL REQUIRE A GREATER QUANTITY OF WEAPONS, MORE MEN, AND ALL THE SUPPORT NECESSARY TO OPERATE. HE SAID THAT THE MONTHS OF TRUCE WERE USED TO FULFILL THESE NEEDS.     THE SPOKESMAN ADDED THAT DURING THE MEETING THEY ALSO DECIDED ON THE NEED TO ESTABLISH A NON-ISOLATED ACTION.  \"WE THOUGHT THAT ACTIONS IN SANTIAGO, CONCEPCION, AND VALPARAISO WOULD BE THE SOLUTION, BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE.\"     DIAZ CARO EXPLAINED THAT \"THIS IS WHY WE NOW REALIZE THAT THE STRUGGLE SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT FROM ARICA DOWN TO MAGALLANES, THROUGHOUT THE TERRITORY AND IN VARIOUS FORMS.\" [CONTINUED]",

THE COMMUNIQUE ASKS THE GOVERNMENT TO OFFER FULL GUARANTEES DURING THE ELECTIONS PROCESS AND TO POSTPONE THE ELECTIONS.  THE FOLLOWING IS THE COMMUNIQUE THAT HAS BEEN ISSUED IN THE ELIPTICO ROOM OF THE NATIONAL CAPITOL:     [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER] WE REPORT TO THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD THE FOLLOWING:     1. WE ONCE AGAIN CONDEMN THE VILE MURDER OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DR. BERNARDO JARAMILLO.  THIS MURDER HAS MADE EVIDENT THE LACK OF GUARANTEES IN THE COUNTRY, GUARANTEES THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS SYSTEMATICALLY DENIED THE OPPOSITION PARTIES.  WE REJECT THE MANIPULATIONS IN WHICH OFFICIAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE ENGAGED IN CONNECTION WITH INVESTIGATING THIS CRIME.     2. WE DENOUNCE THAT THE OFFICIAL APPARATUS IS AT THE SERVICE OF ONLY ONE CANDIDATE AND THAT IT IS PREPARED TO ESTABLISH PARTY PREDOMINANCE THAT WOULD IN PRACTICE BE A REJECTION OF DEMOCRATIC PLURALISM.     3. WE DEMAND FULL GUARANTEES FOR ALL THE FORCES PARTICIPATING IN THE ELECTIONS AND EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THE STATE MEDIA SO THAT THESE FORCES CAN MAKE KNOWN THEIR POLITICAL POSITIONS.     4. WE REQUEST GUARANTEES THAT THE NEW ELECTORAL SYSTEM WILL NOT HAVE THE SAME DIFFICULTIES THAT EXISTED DURING THE 11 MARCH ELECTIONS, THE RESULTS OF WHICH ARE STILL UNKNOWN.     5. UNDER THE CURRENT CONDITIONS, WE ASK OUR REPRESENTATIVES IN THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL TO ABSTAIN FROM PARTICIPATING IN DISCUSSIONS AND DECISIONS OF THAT COUNCIL.     6. IN VIEW OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE HAVE AGREED TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND OUR ELECTION CAMPAIGNS AND DEMAND A POSTPONEMENT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR 27 MAY.     7. WE INSIST THAT THE RATIFICATION OF CARLOS LEMOS SIMMONDS IN THE GOVERNMENT MINISTRY REPRESENTS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION TO FINDING AN INSTITUTIONAL INTERLOCUTOR IN NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.     8. WE ANNOUNCE THE IMMEDIATE PRESENCE OF INTERNATIONAL [WORDS INDISTINCT] TO VERIFY THAT THE ELECTORAL GUARANTEES WE ARE DEMANDING ARE GRANTED AND TO OBSERVE THE ELECTIONS PROCESS.     9. THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE OF THE OPPOSITION HEREBY STATES ITS DECISION TO WORK FOR THE FORMATION OF A CONSTITUENT NATIONAL ASSEMBLY THAT MUST HAVE A DEMOCRATIC AND PLURALISTIC COMPOSITION WITH THE DECIDING PARTICIPATION OF THE NATIONAL [WORD INDISTINCT] TO APPROVE A NEW CONSTITUTION AND TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD FINDING POLITICAL SOLUTIONS TO THE SOCIAL CONFLICT OF COLOMBIA.  WE APPEAL TO THE LEADERS OF THE COUNTRY TO URGE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO DEFEND AND RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS.     10. WE REITERATE OUR POSITION THAT THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THE ARMED CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY IS A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION.     11. WE URGE THE LIBERAL PARTY TO POSTPONE ITS NATIONAL CONVENTION IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE PATRIOTIC UNION AND THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE.     12. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S CALL AND WE WILL PROMOTE THIS CALL THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE.     13. IN DEFENSE OF A PLURALISTIC DEMOCRACY WE WILL MAINTAIN THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE OF THE OPPOSITION WE HAVE CREATED.  WE HEREBY ASK OUR FOLLOWERS AND ALL OUR COUNTRYMEN TO REMAIN ON A STATE OF ALERT.     THIS COMMITTEE WILL HOLD A NEW MEETING TUESDAY 27 MARCH, AT 1500, IN THE CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES.

THE FMLN IS SUPPOSEDLY ATTACKING MILITARY TARGETS, BUT NEITHER A JAIL NOR A SHOPPING MALL IS A MILITARY TARGET. COMMERCIAL AREAS OR AMUSEMENT PLACES ARE NOT MILITARY TARGETS. CAR BOMBS WENT OFF IN SUCH PLACES LATELY. THEY WENT OFF AT A CHAIN OF [WORDS INDISTINCT] AND AT A SHOPPING MALL. THE FMLN'S STRATEGY IS SIMPLY TO INCREASE ITS TERRORIST ACTIONS.     FOR THAT REASON, IT IS REGRETTABLE THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DESCRIBES THE FMLN AS A GROUP IN ARMS, BECAUSE THEY ARE MERELY TERRORIST CRIMINALS. [PASSAGE OMITTED]     THERE IS POLITICAL WEAKNESS, BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES ARE NOT GIVEN CLEAR MISSIONS. WE SEE THE ACTIONS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE SECURITY CORPS ARE FRUSTRATED, BECAUSE THEY SPEND TIME, EFFORT, AND MEN CAPTURING TERRORISTS WHILE THE GOVERNMENT SUBSEQUENTLY RELEASES THEM FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS.     I BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT MUST APPLY THE LAWS MORE FORCEFULLY AND STOP DECEIVING THE POPULATION WITH WORDS SUCH AS DEMOCRATIZATION AND WITH ITS GREAT POLITICAL DEMAGOGY.

THE ARCHBISHOP ALSO REPORTED THAT ANOTHER U.S. NUN, PATRICIA DENNY, LEFT GUATEMALA 17 DAYS AGO BECAUSE OF CONTINUOUS DEATH THREATS OVER THE TELEPHONE AND IN WRITING.     PENADOS SAID DIANA MACK ORTIZ WAS KIDNAPPED ON 2 NOVEMBER IN ANTIGUA GUATEMALA, 45 KM SOUTH OF GUATEMALA CITY, WHEN SHE WAS ATTENDING A SEMINAR ALONG WITH OTHER NUNS.  THE ARCHBISHOP EXPLAINED THE NUN HAD BEEN RECEIVING DEATH THREATS.  SHE HAD BEEN URGED TO LEAVE GUATEMALA, BUT SHE DECIDED TO CONTINUE WORKING IN THIS COUNTRY.     THE KIDNAPPED NUN, WHO HAD BEEN IN GUATEMALA FOR A YEAR, WAS TEACHING AT THE SAN MIGUEL ACATAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN HUEHUETENANGO DEPARTMENT IN NORTHEAST GUATEMALA.  SHE BELONGS TO THE ORDER OF THE URSILINA, PENADOS REPORTED.     PATRICIA DENNY, 54, LEFT GUATEMALA AFTER UNIDENTIFIED MEN WARNED HER THAT IF SHE WISHED TO CONTINUE LIVING SHE HAD TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY.  DENNY HAD ARRIVED IN GUATEMALA IN 1984, BELONGED TO THE SISTERS OF MARY KNOLL, AND WAS WORKING AT A PARISH IN MIXCO MUNICIPALITY IN SOUTHERN GUATEMALA CITY.     THE ARCHBISHOP SAID ALL THIS IS THE \"BEGINNING OF A CAMPAIGN TO INTIMIDATE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.\"  HE DID NOT MENTION WHICH GROUPS ARE PERPETRATING THESE INTIMIDATION ACTIONS.  HOWEVER, PENADOS SAID HE IS GOING TO TALK TO GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO TODAY TO REPORT THE INCIDENTS WITH THE U.S. NUNS.     PENADOS STATED THAT THIS KIND OF ACTION \"HARMED CATHOLICISM VERY MUCH IN PAST YEARS,\" WHEN REPRESSION SEVERELY HIT THIS SECTOR.  HE POINTED OUT THAT THIS KIND OF INCIDENT HAD NOT HAPPENED SINCE PRESIDENT CEREZO TOOK OVER POWER IN GUATEMALA ON 14 JANUARY 1986.     THE ARCHBISHOP DEMANDED THAT MACK ORTIZ' KIDNAPPERS RESPECT HER LIFE AND PHYSICAL INTEGRITY.",

WE HAVE VIEWED WITH GREAT CONCERN THE GOVERNMENT AND ARMY'S REJECTION MR PEREZ DE CUELLAR'S PARTICIPATION IN THE DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION PROCESS AS A MEDIATOR.  THIS ATTITUDE IS AN OBSTACLE TO A PROCESS THAT COULD FACILITATE THE NEGOTIATION EFFORT.  ON OUR PART, WE HAVE ACCEPTED THIS MEDIATION AND WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE IT.     2. THE STATE OF SIEGE, THE ASSASSINATION OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER HECTOR OQUELI, THE DOUBTFUL AND INSUFFICIENT INITIAL RESULTS IN THE CASE OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS, THE ABSENCE OF CONDITIONS FOR THE POLITICAL ACTIVITY OF THE OPPOSITION, THE CONTINUATION OF THE PERSECUTION OF CHURCHES, AND THE LACK OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH THROUGH THE DIRECT OR COVERT GAGGING OF THE PRESS SHOW THAT CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT IS CARRYING OUT A POLICY OF CONFRONTATION WITH ALL THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FORCES.  FOR THIS REASON, THE TERMS OF THE DIALOGUE - NEGOTIATION MUST BE REORIENTED SO THAT IT WILL BE TURNED INTO A NATIONAL PROCESS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL THOSE FORCES.     3. WE VIEW AS GRAVELY ERRONEOUS THE PERSISTENCE OF A GOVERNMENT POLICY BASED ON THE IDEA OF THE FMLN'S ALLEGED MILITARY WEAKNESS.  THIS POSITION, SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT WAS PUT FORTH PRIOR TO 11 NOVEMBER [DATE OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FMLN MILITARY OFFENSIVE] WILL ONLY LEAD THE COUNTRY TO GREATER LEVELS OF CONFRONTATION.     4. WE REAFFIRM OUR WILLINGNESS TO HOLD THE MEETING OF BOTH SIDES WITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL SOON.  WE HOPE THAT MR CRISTIANI'S VISIT TO THE UNITED NATIONS WILL LEAD TO SUCH A MEETING AND THAT WE CAN AGREE WITH THE MEDIATOR ON THE DATE TO HOLD IT.     5.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE U.S. AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS DIRECTED AGAINST DEMOCRATIZATION AND A POLITICAL SOLUTION.  THE SENDING OF SIGNALS TO ONE OR ANOTHER SECTOR OF THE GOVERNMENT OR ARMY, USING THE PRESSURE OF SETTING CONDITIONS OR THREATENING THE END OF AID, DOES NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.  WE BELIEVE THE MEMBERS OF THE U.S. CONGRESS CAN MAKE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO END THE WAR IN OUR COUNTRY BY AGREEING TO SUSPEND THAT AID, SOMETHING WHICH COULD FORM PART OF A NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT THAT WOULD SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTAIL A CEASE-FIRE.

IT WAS RECENTLY REPORTED THAT SEVERAL OFFICERS WHO TESTIFIED DURING THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE NOW ATTENDING TRAINING COURSES ABROAD.  IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE MILITARY SCHOOL'S REGISTRATION BOOK FOR PERSONS ENTERING OR LEAVING THE PREMISES HAD BEEN LOST, INCLUDING THE PAGES THAT CORRESPOND TO NOVEMBER 1989. TODAY, CRISTIANI TALKED ABOUT THIS MATTER AND SAID THE JUDGE SHOULD CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE AND NOT JUST MAKE STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE PROBLEMS.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANY PROBLEM IN THE OFFICERS RETURNING TO THE COUNTRY IF A JUDGE ORDERS THAT THEY COME TO TESTIFY.  ALL THAT IS REQUIRED IS FOR THE JUDGE TO SUMMON THEM; THEY WOULD BE BROUGHT TO THE COUNTRY TO TESTIFY AND, AFTER THAT, RETURNED TO THEIR TRAINING COURSES.  GROUPS OF SOLDIERS ARE FREQUENTLY SENT ABROAD TO TAKE TRAINING COURSES TO MAKE THEM MORE PROFESSIONAL; THIS APPLIES NOT ONLY TO PERSONNEL FROM THE MILITARY SCHOOL, BUT FROM ALL ARMED FORCES UNITS.     CONCERNING THE OTHER MATTER, THE JUDGE HAS TO INVESTIGATE IT.  I BELIEVE THAT INSTEAD OF JUST STAYING THERE, THE JUDGE SHOULD CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE.  TELL ME, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IF THEY ARE BROUGHT BACK FROM SUCHITOTO OR FROM THE UNITED STATES IF THEY MUST TESTIFY BEFORE THE JUDGE?  THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL.  [END RECORDING]     THE PRESIDENT SPOKE TODAY AT THE EL SALVADOR MILITARY AIRPORT BEFORE HE LEFT FOR COSTA RICA TO ATTEND THE INAUGURATION CEREMONY OF PRESIDENT-ELECT RAFAEL CALDERON FOURNIER.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES CONDITIONING 50 PERCENT OF THE AID GIVEN TO OUR COUNTRY COULD CAUSE THE REBEL FRONT TO INCREASE THEIR ACTIONS.  HE ACCUSED THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] OF USING DIALOGUE FOR TACTICAL REASONS.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] WE HAVE STATED THAT AN ACTION OF THIS TYPE WOULD BE VERY UNTIMELY, AS IT COULD MAKE THE MOST RADICAL FMLN MEMBERS DECIDE TO CONTINUE THE WAR AND, THUS, HINDER THE DIALOGUE PROCESS.     [REPORTER] HOWEVER, [WORDS INDISTINCT] PRESSURE GOVERNMENT FOR THEM [WORDS INDISTINCT] WITH FMLN.     [CRISTIANI] I WOULD ASK THE QUESTION: WHO HAS ALWAYS SHOWED GOODWILL AND SINCERELY SOUGHT AN AGREEMENT AND WHO HAS NOT DONE THIS? HISTORY SHOWS THAT IN THE PAST, THE FMLN HAS USED THE PROPOSALS BY [JOSE NAPOLEON] DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT AND MY OWN FOR TACTICAL REASONS. IT HAS NOT BEEN THE GOVERNMENTS.  I BELIEVE THAT THE FMLN MUST UNDERSTAND AND BE PRESSURED TO REALLY SEARCH FOR A POLITICAL SOLUTION. [END RECORDING]     ALSO TODAY, THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL AUTHORIZED A SPOKESMAN TO ANNOUNCE THAT TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND FMLN WILL BE RENEWED ON 16 MAY.  THE PANORAMA THAT SURROUNDS THIS NEW ENCOUNTER, HOWEVER, PRESENTS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PATTERN FROM MEETINGS IN THE PAST, BECAUSE BOTH SECTORS HAVE MET WITH POLITICAL PARTIES REPRESENTED AT THE [WORD INDISTINCT].  FURTHERMORE, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT DONE THE SAME WITH THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL FORCES, THE REBELS WILL TRY TO DO SO THIS WEEK.  UNDOUBTEDLY, THE RESULTS THAT COULD BE OBTAINED FROM THE DIALOGUE COULD BE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THOSE OBTAINED DURING PAST NEGOTIATIONS, BECAUSE ALMOST ALL THE SECTORS THAT HAVE BECOME INVOLVED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN THE NEGOTIATING DEMAND THAT THE AGREEMENTS ATTAINED BE BASED ON INTERNAL COOPERATION.",

SHE HAS DESCRIBED U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CASOLO AS AN ERP [PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY] MEMBER IN CHARGE OF LOGISTICS.     AS HAS BEEN REPORTED, CASOLO WAS RELEASED BY A MILITARY JUDGE AFTER HE DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE AGAINST HER.  SOME GROUPS, HOWEVER, ASSERT THAT CASOLO WAS RELEASED DUE TO POLITICAL PRESSURE FROM THE UNITED STATES, WHICH THREATENED TO LAUNCH A WORLDWIDE CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT EL SALVADOR IF CASOLO WAS NOT RELEASED.     AGUILAR MARROQUIN WAS ARRESTED AT 1500 ON 9 DECEMBER AFTER HAVING PARTICIPATED IN AN ATTACK ON AN URBAN PUBLIC BUS NEAR JUAN PABLO II BOULEVARD.     THE WOMAN FLED AND SOUGHT REFUGE INSIDE THE FACILITIES OF THE SALVADORAN ALBERTO MASFERRER UNIVERSITY, WHERE SHE TOOK A GROUP OF STUDENTS AS HOSTAGES, THREATENING THEM WITH HAND GRENADES. THE POLICE PREVENTED HER FROM DOING ANYTHING AND ARRESTED HER, CONFISCATING ONE .45-CALIBER PISTOL, BULLETS, CARTRIDGES, AND TWO FRAGMENTATION GRENADES.     AGUILAR MARROQUIN SAID THAT SHE JOINED THE ERP LAST MARCH AND THAT SHE WAS PART OF AN URBAN COMMANDO CALLED WORKERS JUSTICE COMMAND. AGUILAR ADDED THAT SHE KNOWS U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CASOLO, WHO BELONGS TO THE ERP, AND THAT CASOLO USED TO MEET WITH TERRORIST LEADER FERNANDO, WORKERS JUSTICE COMMAND OPERATIONS CHIEF, NEAR THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY (UES).     AGUILAR ADDED THAT CASOLO WAS IN CHARGE OF ERP LOGISTICS, ESPECIALLY LODGING PEOPLE AND TRANSPORTING ARMS AND WAR EQUIPMENT. THE ERP HAD GIVEN HER TWO MINIBUSES FOR HER TO CARRY OUT HER TASKS.     IN ADDITION, AGUILAR SAID THAT SHE BELIEVES CASOLO HAD A LEADING POSITION WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION, BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO MEETING WITH FERNANDO, SHE ALSO MET WITH AN INDIVIDUAL KNOWN AS MINCHO, WHO IS THE POLITICAL-MILITARY ERP METROPOLITAN CHIEF AND ALSO THE CHIEF OF THE SO-CALLED URBAN COMMANDOS.     THE PRISONER KNEW ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE ARMS IN CASOLO'S HOUSE, BECAUSE ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS AGUILAR'S CHIEF, KNOWN AS MIRIAM, TOLD HER ABOUT IT. OTHER TERRORISTS WENT TO CASOLO'S HOUSE TO GET WEAPONS, AMMUNITION, AND EXPLOSIVES TO CONDUCT THEIR SABOTAGE OPERATIONS AGAINST BUSES, TELEPHONE DISTRIBUTION BOXES, POWER PYLONS, OR TO CONDUCT LARGE OPERATIONS--AS AGUILAR DESCRIBED THEM-- SUCH AS ATTACKS ON MILITARY GARRISONS.

    "doctext": "CLANDESTINE, 13 DEC 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT] COMRADES: A NEW ELEMENT THAT WE MUST ANALYZE AND EXPLAIN EMERGED AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS' EMERGENCY MEETING. LET US SEE FIRST WHY THE MEETING TOOK PLACE.  THE MAIN REASON IS THE VERY COMPLICATED PREDICAMENT IN WHICH OUR OFFENSIVE HAS PLACED CRISTIANI AND THE HIGH COMMAND.  AS YOU WILL REMEMBER, THE GOVERNMENT HAS MET WITH MUCH INTERNATIONAL DISREPUTE AND ISOLATION BECAUSE OF THE BRUTAL ASSASSINATION OF JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE BOMBING OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.  LET US RECALL, AS A SIGNIFICANT FACT, THAT THE UNITED NATIONS HAS CONDEMNED THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF ALL IT HAS DONE, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE LATEST ATROCITIES.  ON THAT OCCASION, EL SALVADOR WAS THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT VOTED AGAINST THAT RESOLUTION WHILE 96 COUNTRIES VOTED IN FAVOR.     WE MENTION THIS CASE AS A MOST SIGNIFICANT ONE, BUT THE FACT IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH WORLDWIDE CONDEMNATION THAT THE DICTATORSHIP HAS FOUND ITSELF IN A REALLY DESPERATE SITUATION.  THIS WAS A CAUSE OF CONCERN FOR THE NORTH AMERICANS.     TO WHOM COULD THEY TURN AT A TIME WHEN ALL INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HAD TURNED THEIR BACKS ON CRISTIANI?  THE NORTH AMERICANS HAD TO RESORT TO SOME FORUM THAT WOULD NOT CONDEMN THE GENOCIDAL REGIME AND THAT, ON THE CONTRARY, WOULD PROVIDE SUPPORT IN SPITE OF ALL THE ATROCITIES THE REGIME HAS COMMITTED.     THE MOST SUITABLE IDEA WAS TO PROMOTE AN EMERGENCY MEETING OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, BECAUSE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AS WE ALL KNOW, THE NORTH AMERICANS HAVE HAD THEIR BACKYARD AND MOST OF THESE COUNTRIES SERVE THEIR INTERESTS.     THE MEETING WAS CALLED TO TRY TO PULL CRISTIANI OUT OF INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.     UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS DID SUMMIT TAKE PLACE?  WE HAVE TO SAY FIRST THAT THE PRESIDENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND COSTA RICA, AND PROBABLY OF GUATEMALA, HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT PRIOR TO THE MEETING.  THE SUBJECT OF THE DISCUSSION WAS A DOCUMENT DRAFTED BY ARIAS AND CEREZO.  THIS DOCUMENT EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR CRISTIANI FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. JOSEPH SULLIVAN, A U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL IN CHARGE OF LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS, AS WELL AS OTHER U.S.  STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS, WERE PRESENT AT THE MEETING.  THE COSTA RICAN AMBASSADOR TO NICARAGUA -- A PRO-U.S. MAN WHO INTRODUCED THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS AT THE MEETING -- WAS ALSO PRESENT, CONSPIRING ALL THE TIME.  THE FMLN WAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO ENTER COSTA RICA.     HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE MEETING HAD BEEN FIXED AND IN SPITE OF THE U.S. PRESENCE, THE AGREEMENT TO SUPPORT CRISTIANI WAS ACHIEVED ALMOST AT THE PRICE OF KILLING THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENT.  IT WAS NOT EASY.  THE U.S. WILL TO CONDEMN THE FMLN AND TO BACK CRISTIANI PREVAILED IN THE MIDST OF MUCH BICKERING AND THE INSOLENCE OF THE HONDURAN PRESIDENT.     AS YOU CAN SEE, IT WAS NOT EASY TO FIND SUPPORT FOR THE GENOCIDAL REGIME EVEN IN PLACES WHERE THE NORTH AMERICANS THINK THEY HAVE THE BULL BY THE HORNS.     LET US SEE, AS A THIRD POINT, IN WHAT THE DECLARATION CONSISTS. [CONTINUED]",

[PONCE] I BELIEVE THAT SPECIFIC MEASURES WE HAVE ADOPTED HAVE GIVEN US GOOD RESULTS.  THEY HAVE LAUNCHED FOUR SA-7'S IN THE ZACATECOLUCA AREA; HOWEVER, OUR PILOTS HAVE SKILLFULLY AVOIDED THE ROCKETS OR MISSILES, WHICH DID NOT HIT THEIR AIRCRAFT.  WE ARE ADOPTING MEASURES THAT ARE GIVING RESULTS.  WE MUST ALSO CLARIFY THAT WE FEEL THAT SINCE THE LIGHT AIRCRAFT TRANSPORTING THESE MISSILES DID NOT HAVE A NORMAL LANDING AND THE MISSILES WERE NOT IN THEIR ORIGINAL PACKAGE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY SUFFERED SOME FUNCTIONAL DAMAGE WHEN THE PLANE CRASHED SOUTH OF ZACATECOLUCA.  THANK GOD, [WORDS INDISTINCT]     [REPORTER] DO YOU THINK THAT THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS CAN OPEN NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR RESUMING TALKS WITH THE FMLN?  DO YOU THINK THAT THIS SUMMIT COULD BRING ABOUT NEW STEPS TOWARD A DIALOGUE?     [PONCE] YES, I THINK THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR HAS OPENED THIS POSSIBILITY AND IS WILLING TO TALK ON A PERMANENT BASIS.  I THINK THAT AT THIS TIME IT WOULD BE A POSITIVE STEP IN THE POLITICAL FIELD.     HOWEVER, IN THE MILITARY FIELD, WHERE THE FMLN HAS ATTACKED US IN AN IRRATIONAL AND VIOLENT WAY IN THE MAIN CITIES, THE ARMED FORCES IS REPLYING, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO REPLY.  WE WILL COMPLETELY DEFEAT THE FMLN.     BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM OUR UNITS, WE HAVE INFLICTED 1,902 DEAD, 1,209 WOUNDED, AND 44 TERRORISTS HAVE DESERTED AND TURNED THEMSELVES IN TO THE AUTHORITIES.  WE HAVE CONFISCATED A LARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS.  I WILL GIVE YOU THE QUANTITIES: 25 ANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILES -- ONE RED EYE AND 24 SA-7'S -- 915 RIFLES, 12 CARBINES, 11 SHOTGUNS, 156 GRENADE AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 49 MORTARS, 45 MACHINEGUNS, 41 SUBMACHINEGUNS, 67 REVOLVERS AND PISTOLS, 23 RADIOS, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF EXPLOSIVES.     I MUST STRESS THAT THE FMLN HAS GATHERED ALL THESE WEAPONS WITH SUPPPORT FROM ABROAD.  IT IS A LARGE ARSENAL.     I MUST ALSO NOTE THAT MANY OF THE WEAPONS WE FOUND HAD BEEN ABANDONED, WHICH MEANS THAT THE FMLN HAS HAD MANY DESERTIONS.  WE HAVE ALSO FOUND WEAPONS IN HOUSES, THANKS TO THE COLLABORATION OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.     WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE FMLN HAS KIDNAPPED A LARGE NUMBER OF YOUTHS HERE IN THE SAN SALVADOR AREA AND MAINLY IN USULUTAN, AS WELL AS IN CHALATENANGO.  THIS MEANS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO FILL IN THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES THEY HAVE SUFFERED WITH YOUTHS.  THIS ALSO MEANS THAT THEIR EFFICIENCY WILL BE VERY LOW.     [REPORTER] I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS A LEAFLET ISSUED BY THE AIR FORCE, WHICH WAS DROPPED FROM AIRPLANES AND ALSO DISTRIBUTED ON THE STREETS.  THE LEAFLET URGES SALVADORAN PATRIOTS TO DEFEND THEIR HOMELAND, THEIR PROPERTIES, AND LIVES.  IT ALSO SAYS THAT IF NECESSARY, TERRORISTS MUST BE KILLED, AS WELL AS THEIR INTERNATIONALIST ALLIES.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THIS LEAFLET? IS IT NOT AN INVITATION TO KILL FOREIGNERS IN THIS COUNTRY?     [PONCE] I DO NOT THINK SO, BECAUSE THE LEAFLETS MENTION INTERNATIONALISTS, WHO ARE FIGHTING ALONG WITH THE FMLN.  [CONTINUED]",

THE INTERIOR MINISTER SAID THAT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAS OBTAINED GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS IN ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST DRUG TRAFFIKING BY ELIMINATING 80 PERCENT OF THIS ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.     DURAN SAID THAT DURING PAZ' ADMINISTRATION ABOUT 1,000 PEOPLE CONNECTED WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING HAVE BEEN ARRESTED, 1,000 COCAINE LABORATORIES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, AND 20 TONS OF DRUGS HAVE BEEN CONFISCATED.     HE SAID THAT BOLIVIAN SOCIETY HAS WITNESSED THESE ACHIEVEMENTS AS PART OF THE GOVERNMENT'S EFFORT TO ERADICATE DRUG TRAFFICKING FROM THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.     THE INTERIOR MINISTER EXPRESSED GREAT ANNOYANCE AT AN ARTICLE PUBLISHED BY THE NEWSPAPER EL PAIS, OF MADRID, SPAIN, IN WHICH FELIPE KEMPFF, SON OF THE MURDERED BOLIVIAN SCIENTIST NOEL KEMPFF, ASSERTS THAT THE BOLIVIAN AND U.S. GOVERNMENTS ALLOW THE MANUFACTURING OF COCAINE AND USE THE PROCEDES TO FINANCE THE INTERNATIONAL STRUGGLE AGAINST COMMUNISM.     DURAN SAID: \"I WILL ASK THE DISTRICT PROSECUTOR TO SUMMON FELIPE KEMPFF TO COURT IN ORDER TO MAKE HIM TELL EVERYTHING HE KNOWS. HE MUST SAY TO WHOM THE COCAINE LABORATORIES BELONG, HOW MUCH DRUG IT CAN PROCESS, AND WHOM IT BENEFITS.\"     AFTER FELIPE KEMPFF REPORTED THE ALLEGED EXISTENCE OF A SECOND COCAINE LABORATORY IN HUANCHACA, THE SPECIAL ANTINARCOTICS FORCES RAIDED THE AREA FOR 15 DAYS AND WERE UNABLE TO FIND ANY OTHER LABORATORY EXCEPT FOR ONE THAT WAS DISMANTLED IN 1986, MINISTER DURAN SAID.",

WE HAVE BEEN PRESENTING PROPOSALS IN THIS REGARD FOR SOME TIME. THE TOPIC OF DEMOCRATIZATION IS CLOSELY LINKED TO THE TOPIC OF THE ARMED FORCES, TO ITS PURGING, ITS REDUCTION, AND IN SUM, ITS END.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTRY WILL NOT ALWAYS NEED THE ARMED FORCES.  AS WITH ANY INSTITUTION OR HISTORICAL FACTOR, IT EMERGES, IT IS MAINTAINED FOR A CERTAIN TIME, AND THEN IT TENDS TO DISAPPEAR.     THE COUNTRY MUST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP. IT CANNOT CONTINUE ALONG THE SAME PATH BECAUSE THIS WOULD ONLY REPRESENT EXPENSES AND A HEAVY BURDEN FOR THE COUNTRY.     FOR SEVERAL DECADES, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE MEANT ABSENCE OF LIBERTY, REAL SECURITY, AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE CIVILIAN SOCIETY TO DECIDE THE COUNTRY'S PATH.  ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO A MERE FORMALITY, WHERE THOSE WHO WERE NOT ELECTED RUN THE COUNTRY.     THE COUNTRY IS NOW GOING THROUGH A DRAMA THAT HAS ALSO SHOCKED THE INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC, THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.  EVERYONE IS AWAITING THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS AND HOPING THAT THOSE WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CRIME WILL BE PUNISHED.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CASE OF JESUIT PRIESTS IS REALLY GRAVE; IT IS A DRAMA THAT REFLECTS THE DRAMA OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S HISTORY IN THE CURRENT CENTURY. [CONTINUED]",

HOWEVER, THE EMBASSY CONTINUES TO BE OCCUPIED BY APPROXIMATELY 50 DEMONSTRATORS.     AMBASSADOR JESUS FERNANDEZ AND ANOTHER TWO DIPLOMATS, AS WELL AS THREE SALVADORAN TELEVISION JOURNALISTS, ARE STILL BEING HELD HOSTAGE.     APPROXIMATELY 50 PEOPLE LEFT THE BUILDING IN WHICH THEY WERE LOCKED FOR 5 HOURS FOLLOWING THE OCCUPATION OF THE EMBASSY BY MEMBERS AND SYMPATHIZERS OF THE MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO FEDERATION OF COMMITTEES OF MOTHERS AND RELATIVES (FECMAFAM) OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AND MURDERED AND MISSING PEOPLE.     THE AMBASSADOR AND OTHER EMBASSY OFFICIALS STILL REMAIN ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE BUILDING, WHICH WAS SURROUNDED BY DOZENS OF RIOT POLICEMEN EXPERT IN ANTITERRORIST STRUGGLE, ARMED WITH HIGH-CALIBER RIFLES.     RED CROSS, GREEN CROSS, AND RELIEF COMMAND MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN THE EVACUATION OF THE OFFICES IN THE BUILDING.     COLONEL ALEJANDRO SANCHEZ, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE SALVADORAN NATIONAL POLICE, SAID THAT \"THE PROBLEM COULD BE SOLVED WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS, BUT OFFICIAL SOURCES RULED OUT THE USE OF FORCE.     MAURICIO SANDOVAL, DIRECTOR OF THE PRESIDENCY'S COMMUNICATIONS SECRETARIAT, WENT TO \"LA CENTROAMERICANA\" BUILDING, LOCATED IN EL SALVADOR'S BUSINESS DISTRICT, TO LEARN ABOUT THE SITUATION AND DESCRIBED THE OCCUPATION AS A \"PROPAGANDA ACT\" IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE SECOND ROUND OF TALKS BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLAS, SCHEDULED FOR 16 AND 17 OCTOBER IN SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), IS DRAWING CLOSER.     THE FECMAFAM OCCUPIED THE COSTA RICAN EMBASSY TO PROTEST \"AN INCREASE IN REPRESSION AGAINST POPULAR ORGANIZATIONS UNLEASHED BY ALFREDO CRISTIANI'S FASCIST GOVERNMENT,\" FECMAFAM SPOKESMEN SAID.

THE PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMAN ALSO REPORTED THAT, IN THE WAKE OF THESE INCIDENTS, FERNANDEZ HAD A SLIGHT CARDIAC PROBLEM, BUT HAS ALREADY GOTTEN OVER IT.

THE NEWSPAPER STATED THAT THE ALLEGED RIFT BETWEEN THE MILITARY OFFICERS BEGAN ONCE IT WAS DISCOVERED WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, IN WHICH ONE COLONEL, TWO LIEUTENANTS, AND SIX SOLDIERS ARE BEING CHARGED.     COLONEL PONCE SAID THAT THE RELATIONS WITH U.S. ADVISERS -- ABOUT 52 IN THE COUNTRY -- ARE VERY CORDIAL.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] OUR RELATIONS WITH THE NORTH AMERICANS ARE NORMAL AS USUAL.  THE U.S. ADVISERS HAVE HELPED US VERY MUCH IN THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND THEY CONTINUE WORKING WITH US.     [REPORTER] WHERE DO YOU THINK THESE WIRE REPORTS STATING THERE ARE RIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN MILITARY OFFICERS AND U.S.  ADVISERS HAVE ORGINIATED?     [PONCE] I DO NOT KNOW; I CANNOT UNDERSTAND.  THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE WHO TRY TO BREAK THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES AND THE UNITED STATES.  THIS IS A POOR COUNTRY THAT DEPENDS A GREAT DEAL ON U.S. ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID.     [REPORTER] FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS, WHAT ARE RELATIONS LIKE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN MILITARY AND THE GRINGO ADVISERS?     [PONCE] AS USUAL, THESE RELATIONS ARE VERY CORDIAL, AND THEY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US.  AS YOU CAN SEE, TWO ADVISERS ARE HERE WITH ME NOW AT THE TABLE PRESIDING OVER THE EVENT.  THE SAME HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH ALL THE UNITS IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR.  I FAIL TO SEE ANY DIFFERENCE IN RELATIONS BEFORE AND AFTERWARD. [END RECORDING]     THE MILITARY CHIEF REPEATED THE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, NOT ONLY DUE TO THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS, BUT ALSO TO KEEP CONTROL OVER THE ORGANIZATION FRONTS JUST PRIOR TO AN EXPECTED WAVE OF PROTESTS ON THE LATEST GOVERNMENT ECONOMY MEASURES.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] WE MUST START THINKING WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO DOMESTIC ORDER IN THE FACE OF THE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED OR ARE PLANNED.  WE MUST THINK WHAT THE REACTION OF THE PEOPLE OR THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] ORGANIZATION FRONTS WILL BE, AS THEY ALWAYS USE ANY EXCUSE TO DISRUPT DOMESTIC ORDER.  IT WOULD BE GOOD TO LOOK INTO WHAT IS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN DOMESTIC ORDER IN THE COUNTRY. [END RECORDING]     THE HIGH-RANKING MILITARY OFFICER GAVE THESE STATEMENTS AT THE CEREMONY TO TURN OVER COMMAND OF THE CAPTAIN GENERAL GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY.  THE NEW COMMANDER IS COLONEL RICARDO ALFONSO CASANOVA SANDOVAL, WHO REPLACES COLONEL GUILLERMO ALFREDO BENAVIDES MORENO, REMOVED FROM HIS POST AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF ORDERING THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.     MEANWHILE, COLONEL HECTOR HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ HAS BEEN APPOINTED COMMANDER OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE BASED IN USULUTAN, AND IN LA UNION DEPARTMENT THE CHANGE OF COMMAND CEREMONIES OF THE ARMED FORCES MILITARY TRAINING CENTER HAVE TAKEN PLACE, WHERE COLONEL FRANCISCO ARTURO LOPEZ WILL BE IN COMMAND REPLACING COLONEL CARLOS ALFREDO RIVAS, WHO HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.",

THE COMMUNIQUE SAYS THAT TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS THE MIR WILL PROMOTE A TACTIC \"TO DESTABILIZE THE REGIME, TO MAKE THE INSTITUTIONS ILLEGITIMATE, TO DEMOCRATIZE THE COUNTRY, AND TO ACCUMULATE GREATER FORCE.\"     THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO POINTS OUT THAT THE MIR WILL USE \"THE LIMITED POSSIBILITY OF PARTICIPATING IN ELECTIONS BEGINNING IN 1988.\" THIS IS WHY THE MIR SUPPORTS THE REGISTRATION OF A LEFTIST PARTY: TO PREVENT THE EXCLUSION OF THE LEFT AND \"TO PROMOTE THE GAINS OF THE PEOPLE.\"",

NEWSMEN WHO ENTERED THE HOTEL THIS AFTERNOON DURING THE EVACUATION OF BAENA BY DIPLOMATS WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT COMMANDER AMILCAR, KNOWN AS \"EL CHOCO,\" WHO DIRECTED THE COMBAT OPERATIONS IN THE ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD, WAS SEEN TODAY ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE SHERATON HOTEL.     SEVERAL REBELS HAVE SAID THAT FACUNDO GUARDADO (\"COMMANDER ESTEBAN\"), ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT AND ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE OFFENSIVE THAT BEGAN IN THE CAPITAL ON 11 NOVEMBER, IS SOMEWHERE NEAR THE HOTEL.     ACCORDING TO THE REBELS, GUARDADO EXPECTED TO INITIATE THIS AFTERNOON'S \"NEGOTIATIONS\" WITH THE MANAGER OF THE HOTEL, ROBERT NEWELL.  SEVERAL U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS, AS WELL AS ONE FROM GUATEMALA AND ANOTHER ONE FROM CHILE REMAIN IN THE HANDS OF THE REBELS.  EL CHOCO SAID: \"WE CAN RESIST FOR AS LONG AS WE HAVE TO.  ALL THEY CAN DO IS BOMB THE PLACE AND LET US SEE IF THEY ARE WILLING TO DO THAT.\"     ACCORDING TO THE YOUNG GUERRILLA COMMANDER, THE REBEL WITHDRAWAL FROM THE ZACAMIL, CUSCATANCINGO, AND MEJICANOS NEIGHBORHOODS, AMONG OTHERS, \"WAS PART OF THE PLAN\" THAT WAS COMPLETED TODAY WITH THE ARRIVAL AT THE SHERATON HOTEL AREA.  THE REBEL SAID: \"WE HAVE COME HERE TODAY, TO THE ESCALON COLONY, TO THEIR AREA, THE AREA OF THE BOURGEOISIE, TO SEE IF THEY DO HERE WHAT THEY DID WITH THE PEOPLE, WHO WERE HURT BY THE AIR FORCE BOMBING OPERATIONS.\"     AT 0430 (1030 GMT) TODAY, THE FMLN GUERRILLAS INITIATED HEAVY FIGHTING AROUND THE SHERATON HOTEL, WHERE OAS SECRETARY GENERAL JOAO BAENA SOARES WAS STAYING.     BAENA SOARES WAS EVACUATED FROM THE SHERATON HOTEL TO THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMED FORCES STAFF WHERE HE MET WITH THE \"HIGHEST SALVADORAN AUTHORITIES,\" ACCORDING TO DIPLOMATIC AND MILITARY SOURCES.

HE ADDED THAT ONE OF THE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES HIT A WALL OF THE AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS AND THE SHOCK WAVE FROM THE EXPLOSION DAMAGED SOME BUILDINGS.     ACCORDING TO PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS, THE ATTACK WAS PROBABLY A PROPAGANDA PLOY BECAUSE THE DEVICES WERE RUDIMENTARY AND SIMILAR TO FIRECRACKERS.     THE TERRORIST ACTIONS SEEM TO BE MOTIVATED BY THE FACT THAT THE IRREGULAR GROUPS ARE SHRINKING CONSIDERABLY.  EVIDENCE OF THIS IS THE FACT THAT A SUBVERSIVE WHO SURRENDERED ON THE SOUTHERN COAST WAS CARRYING SOME IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN WHICH THE GUERRILLAS ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD MADE A BIG EFFORT TO SHOW THEIR PRESENCE, BUT THAT NOTHING SUBSTANTIAL RESULTED AND THEY SUFFERED MANY CASUALTIES INSTEAD, GRAMAJO SAID.     WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF THESE TERRORIST ACTIONS ON THE TALKS BEING HELD IN OSLO, NORWAY, GRAMAJO SAID THAT THOSE WHO ARE TAKING PART IN THE TALKS DO NOT MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH THE GROUPS THAT CARRY OUT THE TERRORIST ACTIONS.

LAST YEAR, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL STATISTICS, THERE WERE 4,600 VICTIMS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE. ABOUT HALF OF THOSE KILLED WERE PEASANTS.  AN \"INTERNAL WAR,\" UNLEASHED BY THE OLIGARCHY MANY YEARS AGO, IS BEING WAGED AGAINST THEM.  THE ACTIVISTS OF THE COALITION OF LEFT-WING PARTIES AND ORGANIZATIONS, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMUNISTS -- THE PATRIOTIC UNION -- COME NEXT, AFTER THE PEASANTS.  THE PEOPLE KILLED INCLUDE JAIME PARDO LEAL, PRESIDENT OF ITS NATIONAL COORDINATION COMMITTEE, AROUND 30 DEPUTIES, AND MANY MUNICIPAL ADVISORS AND MAYORS.     THE ORGANIZERS OF THE \"DIRTY WAR\" AND THE LEADERS OF THE \"DEATH SQUADS,\" AND OTHER ULTRA-RIGHT-WING FORMATIONS AND THEIR HIRED KILLERS, FEEL THAT THEY CAN GO UNPUNISHED.  THE RESPONSE TO THE TERROR OF THE RIGHT HAS THE ARMED STRUGGLE WHICH HAS CONTINUED FOR MANY YEARS AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM.     IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, VICTIMS OF POLITICAL TERROR ALSO INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE RULING CIRCLES AND THEIR LAW-ENFORCEMENT ORGANS, WAGING AN UNEQUAL STRUGGLE AGAINST THE POWERFUL NARCOTICS MAFIA.  AS A \"SHADOW ECONOMY,\" IT IS TRYING TO BECOME PART OF THE STATE STRUCTURE.  IN THE PAST YEAR THE NARCOTICS BUSINESS HAS \"ENRICHED\" THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY WITH $2 BILLION AND EVEN PROPOSED THAT IT WOULD PAY OFF THE GIGANTIC FOREIGN DEBT.  THE NARCOTICS MAFIA CARRIES OUT REPRISALS AGAINST ITS OPPONENTS.  THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE, A MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT, A DIRECTOR OF THE BIGGEST NEWSPAPER ESPECTADOR, AND, A FEW DAYS AGO, ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR, GOVERNOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTIOQUIA WERE KILLED.  MANY PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES ARE LEAVING THE COUNTRY THROUGH FEAR FOR THEIR OWN LIVES AND THOSE OF THEIR RELATIVES.     THE VIOLENCE IS ESCALATING AND THE IMPRESSION IS BEING FORMED THAT CERTAIN FORCES ARE TRYING TO TAKE THE ATTENTION OF THE 30 MILLION STRONG POPULATION OF COLOMBIA AWAY FROM THE URGENT RESOLUTION OF PRESSING SOCIAL PROBLEMS BY DESTABILIZING INTERNAL LIFE.     SOVIET SOCIETY, IN THE NAME OF OBSERVING BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND CHARITY, CONSIDERS THAT OUR CONSCIENCE CANNOT BE RECONCILED WITH THE ORGY OF POLITICAL TERROR OVERWHELMING COLOMBIA.  WE APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC OF THE WORLD TO RAISE THEIR VOICES AGAINST THIS EVIL IN THE NAME OF THE COMMON SOLIDARITY OF MANKIND.  DRASTIC ACTIONS ARE NEEDED PARTICULARLY ON BEHALF OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS.     WE CONSIDER THAT IN COLOMBIA ITSELF, DIALOGUE BETWEEN OPPOSING SIDES THAT ARE TAKING THE STAND OF PATRIOTISM AND POLITICAL REALISM IS NECESSARY.  THE FRUITFULNESS OF NATIONAL DIALOGUE HAS BEEN PROVED IN PRACTICE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS BY MANY COUNTRIES. THE VITAL INTERESTS OF THE TORMENTED COLOMBIAN PEOPLE CALL FOR CIVIL PEACE.",

ACCORDING TO THE INSURGENTS, THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED ON DIALOGUE WITH THEM SOLELY OUT OF PROPAGANDA CONSIDERATIONS, WITH NO INTENTION OF REACHING ANY AGREEMENT.

A THIRD MEETING WAS TO BE HELD SHORTLY IN VENEZUELA, BUT THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL NOT ATTEND.     THE FMLN LAUNCHED THE MOST IMPORTANT MILITARY OFFENSIVE SINCE 1981 ON 11 NOVEMBER, ATTACKING 50 MILITARY POSITIONS, 20 OF THEM IN SAN SALVADOR.     IN THE FIRST 24 HOURS, THE OFFENSIVE HAS CAUSED NEARLY 300 CASUALTIES (127 DEAD AND 155 WOUNDED) ACCORDING TO THE ARMY, AND OVER 400 CASUALTIES ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS.     THE OFFENSIVE HAS BEEN NAMED \"OUT WITH THE FASCISTS! FEBE ELIZABETH LIVES!\" IN HOMAGE TO A TRADE UNION LEADER KILLED 13 DAYS AGO ALONG WITH NINE OTHER WORKERS IN A DYNAMITE EXPLOSION IN THE CAPITAL CITY ATTRIBUTED TO THE ULTRARIGHTIST DEATH SQUADS.     ARMED WITH AN AUTOMATIC AK-47 RIFLE, AMILCAR SAID THAT THE FMLN \"HAS CONSOLIDATED THE ZACAMIL, CUSCATANCINGO, MEJICANOS, AND PANAMA NEIGHBORHOODS, AND WE HAVE BESIEGED THE 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE.\"     ALL THE PLACES HE MENTIONED ARE IN NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR, WHERE THE BLOODIEST CLASHES BETWEEN THE GUERRILLAS AND THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS HAVE TAKEN PLACE.     AT NIGHTFALL ON 12 NOVEMBER AND PRIOR TO THE CURFEW THAT BEGINS AT 2000 (0200 GMT), THE RESIDENTS OF ZACAMIL WERE OUTSIDE THEIR BUILDINGS CARRYING CANDLES AS THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY.     AMILCAR ASSURED THAT THE GUERRILLAS HAVE INFLICTED AT LEAST 18 CASUALTIES ON THE ARMED FORCES IN THAT AREA AND HAVE SEIZED ABOUT 20 RIFLES AND 1 M-60 MACHINEGUN.     \"THIS OFFENSIVE IS A MILITARY AND POLITICAL ACHIEVEMENT. AS A RESULT OF THE CLOSING OF THE COMALAPA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, THE MAIN AIRPORT OF THE COUNTRY, WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN LETTING THE WORLD THAT WE ARE AT WAR AND ARE AN EMERGING POWER,\" THE REBEL COMMANDER SAID.

LAST NIGHT WE REPORTED THAT THE ARCH OF LIBERTY EXISTS IN THE CAPITAL; IT IS COMPRISED OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND HOUSING PROJECTS -- WHERE THE PROTAGONISTS OF THIS HISTORY ARE THE MASSES, WHICH ARE ORGANIZED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF TRENCHES AND BARRICADES.  THE PEOPLE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PROTAGONISTS IN THIS HISTORIC ACTION.     RADIO VENCEREMOS URGES THE PEOPLE TO MULTIPLY THEIR ORGANIZATION IN EACH NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN.  POPULAR COMMITTEES MUST BE ORGANIZED; THE PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE THEMSELVES; BUT IF THE ENEMY IS NEAR, THIS MUST BE DONE CLANDESTINELY.  ALL THE GROUPS IN EACH TOWN, MEANING THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS, STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS, TEACHERS ORGANIZATIONS, AND COOPERATIVES, MUST ALL ORGANIZE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR POLITICAL BELIEFS.  OUR UNITY MUST BECOME THE BEST TOOL TO EVICT, ONCE AND FOR ALL, THE MURDEROUS MILITARY DICTATORSHIP WHICH ASSASSINATES PRIESTS AND WHICH BOMBED THE CAPITAL AGAIN EARLY THIS MORNING.  IT HAS AGAIN CAUSED MORE DEATHS AND WOUNDED IN SAN SALVADOR.     IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE TO ORGANIZE COMMITTEES IN EACH NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN, AND THE WHOLE COMMUNITY MUST PARTICIPATE. IF THE ARMED FORCES ARE NEAR, THEN CLANDESTINE ORGANIZATION MUST BE CONDUCTED IN SMALL TOWNS, VILLAGES, AND NEIGHBORHOODS.  THE PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE THEMSELVE TO CONSPIRE AGAINST DEATH, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THE ASSASSINS, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST POVERTY, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST HUNGER, AND TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THE BOMBINGS.  IT IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE PEOPLE; IT IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.  EL SALVADOR MUST BECOME A BODY COMPRISED OF ORGANIZED CELLS -- EVERYWHERE AND IN EVERY POSSIBLE FORM -- REGARDLESS OF THE PEOPLE'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR POLITICAL PARTY.     WE ISSUE AN APPEAL TO THE DECEIVED ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] RANK AND FILE, WHO VOTED BELIEVING THAT THIS GOVERNMENT WOULD REPRESENT A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.  WE ALSO ISSUE AN APPEAL TO ALL THE PATRIOTIC CITIZENS OF THE HOMELAND, URGING THEM TO STOP THE DESTRUCTION OF THE CAPITAL, TO STOP THE DESTRUCTION OF THE COUNTRY. WE URGE THEM TO UNITE AND STOP THE WAR; AND THE END OF THE WAR IS NEAR -- WITH THE PEOPLE'S VICTORY.  [CONTINUED]",

ACCORDING TO CHICA, THE FMLN LEADERS IN MANAGUA DECIDED TO LAUNCH THE OFFENSIVE, TRUSTING THE UNTS LEADERS' REPORTS THAT CONDITIONS WERE RIGHT FOR AN INSURRECTION BECAUSE FEBE ELIZABETH VELAZQUEZ' DEATH IN THE DYNAMITE ATTACK AGAINST FENASTRAS [SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION] HAD IGNITED THE PEOPLE'S SPIRITS.

I HAVE CALLED THIS NEWS CONFERENCE TO READ A FOREIGN MINISTRY COMMUNIQUE: [WORDS INDISTINCT] TODAY THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT TOLD LUIS SANDIGA CABRERA, OUR CHARGE D'AFFAIRES IN PANAMA, THAT HE MUST LEAVE PANAMA IN 72 HOURS.     2.  WE HAVE EXPRESSED TO THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE PANAMANIAN CHARGE D'AFFAIRES IN LIMA, OUR SURPRISE AND STRONG PROTEST OVER THAT DECISION.     3.  IN VIEW OF THIS DECISION, THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED TO REDUCE THE PERSONNEL OF ITS DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN PANAMA AND TO MAINTAIN ITS RELATIONS WITH THAT COUNTRY AT THE FIRST SECRETARY LEVEL. PERU WILL IN THIS WAY CONTINUE TO FULFILL THE HUMANITARIAN MISSION OF PROTECTING THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT ASYLUM IN ITS EMBASSY IN PANAMA WHILE THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT ISSUES THE SAFE-CONDUCTS THAT WE REQUESTED IN ACCORDANCE TO THE CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM SIGNED IN CARACAS ON 28 MARCH 1954.     PERU IS CONTACTING THE MEMBERS OF THE PERMANENT MECHANISM FOR CONSULTATION AND POLITICAL AGREEMENT [GROUP OF EIGHT] TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION AND TO ASK FOR SOLIDARITY AND COOPERATION IN OVERCOMING THIS MOMENTARY CRISIS.     THE DELICATE SITUATION REGARDING THE PEOPLE AT THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY HAS PROVOKED OUR JUSTIFIED ALARM AND IMPELLED US TO BEGIN TALKS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR DIPLOMATIC ASYLUM WILL BE RESPECTED.  WE HAVE TALKED WITH THE AMBASSADORS FROM THE COUNTRIES OF THE PERMANENT MECHANISM FOR CONSULTATION AND POLITICAL AGREEMENT.  I HAVE PERSONALLY SPOKEN WITH THE AMBASSADORS OF VENEZUELA, MEXICO, AND COLOMBIA.     I AM NOW READY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS:     [REPORTER] MR LARCO COX, UNOFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE SAID THAT THE PEOPLE IN THE PERUVIAN EMBASSY IN PANAMA ARE NOT EXACTLY POLITICAL REFUGEES BUT COMMON CRIMINALS.  WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THIS?     [LARCO COX] THE COUNTRY THAT GRANTS ASYLUM DETERMINES THIS.  WE HAVE BEEN VERY CAREFUL TO REVIEW EACH ONE OF THEM AND THEIR FILES.  WE HAVE CHECKED TO SEE IF ANY OF THEM WERE FACING ANY TRIALS IN PANAMA OR THE UNITED STATES.  OUR INVESTIGATION HAS REVEALED THAT NONE OF THEM ARE FACING ANY TRIALS.  THE CHARGES WERE MADE AFTERWARD.  WE SEE THIS AS A RESULT OF THE EMOTIONAL CLIMATE PRESENTLY EXISTING IN PANAMA.     [REPORTER] WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL OPINION OF THE INCIDENT?     [LARCO COX] IT IS THE DIPLOMATIC WAY TO EXPRESS A PROTEST OVER WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE.  ACCORDING TO PANAMANIAN REPORTS, CHARGE D'AFFAIRES LUIS SANDIGA HAS MADE STATEMENTS ON THE SITUATION THAT DID NOT PLEASE THE GOVERNMENT.  THE TRUTH IS THAT SANDIGA HAS NOT MADE ANY DECLARATIONS.  HOWEVER, FORMER AMBASSADOR CASTRO ARENAS IS IN PANAMA AND HE HAS EMBARKED ON A CAMPAIGN IN WHICH HE IS SEEKING RETALIATION AGAINST THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT.  HE COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING BETTER THAN TO POINT AT SANDIGA AS THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLEGED STATEMENTS.  SANDIGA HAS NOT SAID A WORD ABOUT THE SITUATION BECAUSE THAT IS NOT HIS JOB.  BESIDES, HIS CAR AND THE CAR BELONGING TO ONE OF THE EMBASSY'S MILITARY ATTACHES HAVE BEEN STOLEN; THERE IS NO WAY TO BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION.     [REPORTER] ARE YOU SAYING THAT FORMER AMBASSADOR CASTRO ARENAS IS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SITUATION?     [LARCO COX] YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS.     [REPORTER] IF THE SITUATION DETERIORATES, WILL PERU RECALL ALL OF ITS PERSONNEL FROM PANAMA?     [LARCO COX] WE CANNOT GO TO THAT EXTREME BECAUSE WE ARE FULFILLING A HUMANITARIAN CAUSE, AS WE SAID IN THE COMMUNIQUE.  OUR FIRST RESPONSIBILITY AT THIS TIME IS TO SEE THAT THE RIGHT OF ASYLUM IS RESPECTED.  AS LONG AS THE REFUGEES REMAIN IN THE EMBASSY, WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR REPRESENTATION AT THE LEVEL OF FIRST SECRETARY. [END RECORDING]",

THIS IS, HOWEVER, A CRITICAL MOMENT FOR THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT, AND HE KNOWS IT.  BUT THIS POINT WAS ALSO STRESSED BY THE LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO BOOED HIM AT NEARLY EVERY LARGE U.S.  CITY HE VISITED.  ALTHOUGH THE GHOSTS OF THE ASSASSINATED JESUITS SHADOWED HIM ALL DURING HIS TOUR, THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] REPRESENTATIVE, JUST AS HIS PREDECESSOR JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE DID, FLEW TO THE UNITED STATES TO TRY TO CONVINCE THE LEGISLATORS, PARTICULARLY THE DEMOCRATS, THAT HE INTENDS TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE FOR PEACE AND CHECK THE ARMY'S CRIMINAL ASPIRATIONS.  WAVING THE HUMAN RIGHTS FLAG HAS BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR CRISTIANI, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE HE IS AWARE THAT WITH THIS ACTION HE CAN CONTINUE TO RECEIVE WASHINGTON'S FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR HIS GOVERNMENT.     ACCORDING TO TO SOME EXPERTS, CRISTIANI WENT FARTHER THAN HIS PREDECESSOR.  HE ASKED THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO HELP IN THE RESUMPTION OF TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS, REPLACED SEVERAL MILITARY OFFICERS OF DOUBTFUL REPUTATION, AND ASSURED HE WILL PUNISH SEVERELY EIGHT SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF ASSASSINATING THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS.  WE MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT, PRIOR TO HIS TRIP, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT SUCCEEDED IN CURBING A COUP ATTEMPT STAGED BY ARMY REACTIONARY GROUPS. MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN OPPOSITION HAVE COINCIDED IN THER VIEW THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD A HEAD OF STATE CHALLENGED THE MILITARY HIERARCHY TO SUCH AN EXTENT, A HIERARCHY THAT OPPOSES ALL NEGOTIATION WITH THE GUERRILLAS.  THE EXPERTS ALSO SAID, HOWEVER, THAT THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL SITUATION HAS NEVER BEEN SO SERIOUS.     THE REBEL OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED IN NOVEMBER IS A LANDMARK, AFTER WHICH EVERYTHING WILL BE DIFFERENT IN EL SALVADOR, BEGINNING WITH THE GOVERNMENT PARTY, WHICH WAS LEFT IN A VERY DELICATE SITUATION IN THE EYES OF INFLUENTIAL U.S. POWER CIRCLES.  THE GUERRILLA DRIVE ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT ONLY TWO ALTERNATIVES ARE LEFT FOR THE COUNTRY.  IF SERIOUS PEACE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOT INITIATED, THE COUNTERINSURGENCY POLICY WILL BE AGGRAVATED. THIS COULD EVEN GIVE THE UNITED STATES A PRETEXT TO INTERVENE DIRECTLY IN THE COUNTRY.     ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH SAID HE WOULD CONTINUE TO AID EL SALVADOR, A LARGE NUMBER OF LEGISLATORS FOR A LONG TIME HAVE BEEN QUESTIONING WHAT USE HAS BEEN NEARLY $4 BILLION DELIVERED TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY IN 10 YEARS OF WAR.  IF FOR THE WHITE HOUSE THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO CONTINUE TO GIVE MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR OR RESIGN ITSELF TO AN EVENTUAL VICTORY OF THE REBELS, FOR CRISTIANI THE SITUATION IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE, TO GET MORE MONEY, HE MUST ENSURE THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED.  THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO INFLUENCING THE MOST REACTIONARY MILITARY OFFICERS AND GUARANTEEING THE FULFILLMENT OF THE FAMOUS ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN ADVOCATED BY HIS PARTY.  THESE POINTS ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLY WITH IN A COUNTRY IMMERSED IN WAR.  IF THE ECONOMY IS WEAK, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IS EVEN WEAKER.  ANYWAY, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING TO INCREASE AID FOR THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  THIS CONTRIBUTES TO PUTTING FAR INTO THE DISTANCE ANY PLANS TO END THE WAR.",

ASKING FOR AN END TO THE WAR AND NEGOTIATIONS IS LIKE DEMANDING THAT THE SITUATION BE CHANGED WITHOUT HAVING WON THE WAR.  IN ADDITION TO BEING UNREALISTIC, THIS IS A FORMULA FOR NOT NEGOTIATING AND CONTINUING THE WAR.     IN THE ESQUIPULAS II DOCUMENTS, THE GOVERNMENTS URGE THE SIDES TO AGREE TO A CEASE-FIRE.  THE TELA ACCORDS ALSO APPEAL TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FMLN IN THE SPIRIT OF THE ESQUIPULAS II ACCORDS.  THIS PARTICULAR AGREEMENT LINKS THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES TO DEMOCRATIZATION, SOCIAL JUSTICE, AND SELF-DETERMINATION AS A HARMONIOUS, INDIVISIBLE WHOLE.  THIS CONCEPT IS SUPPORTED BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL IN ITS RESOLUTION 637 OF 27 JULY 1989.  IN ADDITION, THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE MEXICAN ACCORD READS AS FOLLOWS: THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN WILL TALK IN AN EFFORT TO REACH AN UNDERSTANDING THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS TO CONCLUDE THE ARMED CONFLICT THROUGH POLITICAL MEANS AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN WILL FOSTER THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIZATION AND REUNITE SALVADORAN SOCIETY.  THE DIALOGUE IS MEANT TO SERVE AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR REACHING AN AGREEMENT ON CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES.  THE AGREEMENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT SIGNED IN MEXICO SAYS NOTHING OF TALKING ABOUT OR NEGOTIATING THE FMLN'S DEMOBILIZATION BUT MENTIONS NEGOTIATIONS TO ENCOURAGE DEMOCRATIZATION TO AGREE ON THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES.     BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, CRISTIANI IS CLOSING THE DOOR TO DEMOCRATIZATION.  THIS, PLUS HIS REFUSAL TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FMLN, MAKES HIM GUILTY OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE COMMITMENTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT MADE AT ESQUIPULAS.     3.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMMITMENT WE MADE IN MEXICO AND WITH THE REGIONAL ACCORDS, WE REITERATE OUR FULL WILLINGNESS TO AGREE WITH THE GOVERNMENT ON A CEASE-FIRE AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AND TO ATTEND THE UPCOMING NEGOTIATION MEETING IN COSTA RICA.  FOR THIS MEETING, WE HAVE INCLUDED IN OUR PEACE PROPOSAL AN AGREEMENT ON A CEASE-FIRE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING POINTS: REFORMS TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM; CESSATION OF REPRESSION; TRIAL OF BOTH THOSE GUILTY OF THE MURDER OF MONSIGNOR ARNULFO ROMERO AND THOSE FOUND TO BE MEMBERS OF THE DEATH SQUADS; ENFORCEMENT OF THE 1980 ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS; AND SUSPENSION OF THE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT EXACERBATE THE CRISIS AND THE WAR; PURGE OF THE ARMY; CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS; HOLDING THE 1991 ELECTIONS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE; MINIMUM OPERATIONAL GUARANTEES TO ESTABLISH GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS FOR THE FORCES TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE CEASE-FIRE.     AFTER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE PRESENCE OF THE UN AND OAS SECRETARY GENERALS' REPRESENTATIVES, WHO WILL SERVE AS WITNESSES AT THE DIALOGUE TABLE, CRISTIANI AGREED TO INVITE THEM TO THE COSTA RICA MEETING.  WE HOPE HE KEEPS HIS WORD BECAUSE THIS WILL LEND SERIOUSNESS TO THE PROCESS AND GUARANTEE THE NEGOTIATIONS INITIATED IN MEXICO.     SIGNED THE FMLN GENERAL COMMAND",

THOUSANDS ARE DEAD, PARAMILITARY DEATH SQUADS GO UNPUNISHED DESPITE THEIR MURDERS OF PATRIOTIC UNION [UP] MEMBERS AND POPULARLY ELECTED LEGISLATORS. MR PRESIDENT, HOW CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS SITUATION AND HOW CAN YOU RECONCILE THE SITUATION EXISTING IN YOUR COUNTRY WITH YOUR AFFIRMATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF DEMOCRACY? THANK YOU.     [BARCO] I DO NOT BELIEVE YOUR QUESTION IS RELEVANT TO THE COMPOSITION AND PURPOSE OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT MEETING.  THE QUESTION ARISES FROM A LACK OF INFORMATION. COLOMBIA IS A DEMOCRACY, SUPPORTED BY A PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES.  THE SOLDIERS ARE COLOMBIANS WHO ARE COMPLYING WITH THE REQUIREMENT TO PERFORM MILITARY SERVICE. THEY ARE YOUTHS FROM ALL GROUPS, FROM THE RURAL AREAS, THE CITIES, AND FROM ALL POLITICAL PARTIES. THE OFFICERS ARE PROFESSIONALS, AND THEY DO NOT FOLLOW MILITARIST DOCTRINES.     THE ARMED FORCES MEMBERS WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED--MAY I ADD ON AN INDIVIDUAL AND PERSONAL BASIS--IN ANY HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION, WILL BE ARRAIGNED BEFORE A MILITARY COURT, AND MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN EXPELLED. CIVIL COURTS HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF SOME OF THOSE CRIMES, AND SOME ARREST WARRANTS HAVE BEEN ISSUED. MILITARY JUSTICE AUTHORITIES ARE ALSO CONDUCTING LEGAL ACTIONS. [END RECORDING]     DURING THE SAME NEWS CONFERENCE THIS MORNING, PRESIDENT BARCO NOTIFIED JOURNALISTS THAT LAST THURSDAY'S STRIKE HAD BEEN AN ATTEMPT BY ARMED REBEL GROUPS AGAINST DEMOCRACY. HE ALSO SAID THAT THE PRESS CENSORSHIP DECREE WAS NO LONGER VALID.",

LLOREDA CAICEDO, FOREIGN MINISTER DURING BELISARIO BETANCUR'S ADMINISTRATION AND ONE OF THE PROPONENTS OF THE CONTADORA GROUP TO ATTAIN PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, SAID THAT AN EFFORT MUST BE MADE TO \"RECOVER THE MONOPOLY OF THE PUBLIC FORCE AND CONSOLIDATE ITS SOVEREIGN PRESENCE.\"     ALVARO GOMEZ HURTADO, 71, A \"DISSIDENT\" CONSERVATIVE, MAINTAINS THAT WITHOUT THE STRENGTHENING OF MORALS AND THE LAW -- \"THE ROOT OF OUR ILLS\" -- COEXISTENCE AND PROGRESS WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE.  HE PLEDGES TO RESCUE THOSE TWO VALUES.     GOMEZ HURTADO PRESENTED TO COLOMBIAN VOTERS A FIVE-POINT \"AGREEMENT ON BASIC ISSUES,\" INCLUDING LAW AND MORALS, JUSTICE, ECONOMIC PLANNING, AND ECOLOGY, AS HIS GOVERNMENT PLATFORM IF HE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT ON 27 MAY.     ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, THE M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, WHO REPLACED THE ASSASSINATED CARLOS PIZARRO, BELIEVES THAT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM ARE \"BASIC\" TO REACHING PEACE.     NAVARRO WOLFF, 41, HAS REITERATED THAT HE DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS, AND HE ALSO CONDEMNED THE CHAIN OF ATTACKS PERPETRATED BY DRUG TERRORISTS IN THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS.     REGARDING THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, HOWEVER, HE SAID THAT THEY REQUIRE \"MORE SERIOUS TREATMENT.\"  THEREFORE, IT IS BETTER TO HAVE \"A POOR DIALOGUE RATHER THAN A GOOD WAR,\" AND IF THAT DIALOGUE PRODUCES GOOD RESULTS \"WE MUST HOLD ON TO IT,\" HE SAID.     THE FOUR CANDIDATES AGREE ON REFORMING THE CONGRESS OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE CONSTITUTION BY CONVOKING A NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY. THEY ALSO SHARE OPINIONS ON THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC OPENING TOWARD INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, ACCESS TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT, AND PROMOTION OF AN \"AGRO-INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION\" WHICH WILL GUARANTEE A REDUCTION OR STABILIZATION OF THE RATE OF INFLATION.",

[DUARTE] I UNDERSTAND THAT AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL HAS TO PREPARE A REPORT EVERY YEAR, AND THE ORGANIZATION INCLUDES WHATEVER VIEWS IT CHOOSES IN THE REPORT. THE ORGANIZATION OBVIOUSLY STATES ITS VIEWS IN THE REPORT.  SALVADORANS DO THINGS ACCORDING TO THE LAW. IF ANY SALVADORAN OR FOREIGNER HAS EVIDENCE [OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS], THEN IT SHOULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURTS.  THAT IS THE LOGICAL AND LEGAL WAY FOR US TO BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION; THAT IS WHAT WE ALWAYS DO IN ALL SUCH CASES.     [REPORTER] MR PRESIDENT, YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED A SPECIAL REPORT CLAIMING THAT SOME DEATH SQUAD MEMBERS HAVE DESERTED AND IMPLICATED SEVERAL RIGHT-WING MEMBERS IN THE MURDER OF MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO AND OTHER SALVADORANS.     [DUARTE] WE ARE ANALYZING THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IN THOSE CASES. YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE CAREFULLY ANALYZED THE CASES. I RELEASED INFORMATION ONLY WHEN THE EVIDENCE WAS DULY INVESTIGATED AND CORROBORATED. WE ARE PROCESSING A SIZABLE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION, BUT I DO NOT WANT TO DISCUSS IT IN DETAIL BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD HINDER THE INVESTIGATION.     [REPORTER] IS IT TRUE THAT YOU HAVE TWO VIDEO RECORDINGS IN WHICH THE TWO DESERTERS GIVE THEIR NAMES AND DETAILS AND THAT THESE RECORDINGS ARE BEING ANALYZED BY MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND THE GOVERNMENT?     [DUARTE] WE ARE CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING THE CASE. THAT IS WHY I SAID THAT I WOULD NOT LIKE TO REVEAL ANY DETAILED INFORMATION--BECAUSE THIS MIGHT HINDER THE INVESTIGATION.

THESE TWO COUNTRIES ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR COCAINE CROPS AND THE DRUG CARTEL'S ORGANIZED ACTIVITIES.  IN ADDITION, EXTREMIST RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING ORGANIZATIONS THERE ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO ACHIEVE POLITICAL GOALS THROUGH TERRORIST ACTIVITY.     HADASHOT HAS LEARNED FROM A SOURCE WHO WAS IN PERU FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS THAT ELEMENTS LINKED TO THE DRUG GROWERS SPENT APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION ON MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM ISRAELI ARMS DEALERS IN 1987.  THE EQUIPMENT INCLUDED GALIL RIFLES, FLAK JACKETS, AMMUNITION BELTS AND AMMUNITION, VARIOUS TYPES OF GRENADES, AND COMMUNICATIONS AND NIGHT VISION EQUIPMENT.  IN 1988 AND 1989, IN ADDITIONAL DEALS WORTH SOME $6 MILLION, MORTARS, SHELLS, SNIPER RIFLES, AND AMMUNITION FOR LIGHT WEAPONS WERE PURCHASED.     THE ARMS WERE SENT TO PERU VIA MEXICO AND GUATEMALA.  AT LEAST 3 IDF [ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES] RESERVE OFFICERS WERE IN PERU FOR OVER 2 MONTHS IN EARLY 1988 TO ORGANIZE FIGHTING UNITS.  THE PERUVIAN FIGHTERS WERE PRESENTED TO THE OFFICERS AS BELONGING TO RIGHT-WING POLITICAL BODIES IN THE COUNTRY, AND THE TEAM OF INSTRUCTORS INCLUDED MERCENARIES FROM THE NETHERLANDS AND ENGLAND.     THE TEAM OF INSTRUCTORS WAS MADE UP OF SOME 10 PEOPLE, SOME OF WHOM WERE RECRUITED THROUGH AN ISRAELI-NETHERLANDER ARMS DEALER WHO LIVES IN AMSTERDAM.  THE NETHERLANDS MEDIA IS CONDUCTING A WIDE-RANGING INVESTIGATION INTO THE SUBJECT DESPITE THE SURPRISING LACK OF INTEREST BY THE NETHERLANDS AUTHORITIES IN THE AFFAIR.     AT THE SAME TIME, ISRAELIS IN NEIGHBORING BOLIVIA ACTED AS INSTRUCTORS IN A COURSE ON SAFEGUARDING BUSINESSMEN, GUERRILLA WARFARE, AND REGIONAL DEFENSE.  THESE ISRAELIS REACHED BOLIVIA IN THE WAKE OF AN ARMS CONSIGNMENT WORTH SOME $12 MILLION, WHICH ARRIVED IN PERU [COUNTRY AS PUBLISHED] VIA A THIRD PARTY, WHICH PURCHASED IT IN AN AFRICAN COUNTRY, WHICH IN TURN HAD RECEIVED IT FROM ISRAEL.     FOLLOWING THE REPORTS ON DEALS BY ISRAELIS ABROAD, THE INCOME TAX INVESTIGATIONS DIVISION HAS BEGUN AN INQUIRY INTO TAX PAYMENTS ON ISRAELI ARMS DEALS AND TRAINING ABROAD.     IN THE PAST 5 YEARS, THE SCOPE OF COMMISSIONS PAID TO ARMS DEALERS IS ESTIMATED AT $1 BILLION.  AT LEAST HALF OF IT WENT TO BIG DEALERS, SUCH AS SHA'UL EISENBERG, MARCUS KATZ, PESAH BEN-OR, ISRACES, AND OTHERS.  THEY ARE NOT UNDER SUSPICION OF TRYING TO CHEAT OR HIDE INFORMATION FROM THE TAX AUTHORITIES.",

SECOND, URBAN GUERRILLA ACTIVITY IS INCREASING. THE ARMED FORCES ARE JUSTIFIABLY CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE ISSUES.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] I NEVER TALK ABOUT DEATH SQUADS.

[VILLAGRAN] RIGHT NOW, THE POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC COMMISSION, ON DIRECTIONS FROM THE URNG GENERAL COMMAND, IS MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO HUMANIZE THE WAR SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY BY SHOWING RESPECT FOR THE GENEVA AGREEMENT, WHICH GUATEMALA SIGNED.     WE ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE THE REPRESSIVE WAR THE ARMY HAS BEEN WAGING AGAINST THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT AND THE POPULATION HAS REACHED LEVELS OF EXTREME CRUELTY, INCLUDING INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS AND THE USE OF DEFOLIANTS IN CONFLICT ZONES WHERE CIVILIANS LIVE.     THERE IS THE PARTICULAR SITUATION IN WHICH NEITHER THE GUATEMALAN ARMY NOR THE GOVERNMENT TAKE ANY WAR PRISONERS.

[MARTINEZ] DOES THE URNG HAVE ANY PRISONERS AT THIS MOMENT?     [VILLAGRAN] YES.

WE APPLAUD AND CONGRATULATE THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR DETERMINATION AND THE STOICISM WITH WHICH THEY, THE BRAVE SALVADORAN CITIZENS, HAVE CONFRONTED THESE MOMENTS OF TRAGEDY AND CHALLENGE.     WE SAY: SALVADORAN PEOPLE, THIS INSTITUTION -- YOUR ARMED FORCES -- IS AT YOUR SIDE.  THE ARMED FORCES ARE WILLING TO SHED THEIR BLOOD AND GIVE THEIR LIVES PRECISELY SO THAT THE CHILDREN OF OUR PEOPLE, SO THAT THE CHILDREN OF OUR CHILDREN, CAN ASPIRE TO A WORTHY, FREE, JUST, AND INDEPENDENT LIFE.     WE WISH TO CONGRATULATE OUR PEOPLE FOR THEIR ATTITUDE.  WE WISH TO CONGRATULATE ALL THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE BECAUSE, WITH THEIR WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT SENT TO US THROUGH DIFFERENT MEANS, THE INSTITUTION FEELS STRONGER AND MORE WILLING TO DEFEND THE REAL ASPIRATIONS OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.     THIS BRAVE ATTITUDE -- THIS ATTITUDE THAT REFLECTS THE REAL SALVADORANS -- IS, WITHOUT DOUBT, THE STRONGEST RESPONSE AND THE WORST PUNISHMENT THE TERRORIST FORCES COULD RECEIVE.  [CONTINUED]",

THERE HAS BEEN TALK ABOUT THAT IN RECENT DAYS. ALL INDICATIONS ARE, INDEED, THAT BECAUSE TIME IS RUNNING SHORT THEY WILL START UP WITHOUT MUCH CIRCUMSPECTION. TO PUT IT MORE CLEARLY, THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT THEY WILL WAIT UNTIL THINGS ARE UNDER WAY BEFORE TRYING TO PUT THEIR OWN MARK ON THE NEWBORN.     CHRISTIAN LEFT [IC] WAS THE FIRST TO GIVE THIS SIGNAL. THE RESOLUTIONS OF ITS PLENUM, MADE PUBLIC ON 28 OCTOBER, CLEARLY REVEALED THAT IT INTENDED TO UNIFY THE ENTIRE LEFT IN THE FORMATION OF THE NEW POLITICAL ENTITY. IN PASSING, THEY SENT A MESSAGE TO THEIR MEN WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE PPD [PARTY FOR DEMOCRACY]: THEY HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN MEMBERSHIP IN ONE OR THE OTHER, BUT NOT BOTH.  THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MAPU [UNITED POPULAR ACTION MOVEMENT]-BARRUETO IS NOT ADDRESSING WITH THE SAME EARNESTNESS. THEY APPARENTLY SEEK TO TAKE PART IN EVERY GROUP THERE IS, WHETHER IT IS CALLED THE PPD, COSONO [SOCIALIST COMMAND FOR THE NO] OR LEFTIST PARTY.     THE CHRISTIAN LEFT PEOPLE WENT EVEN FURTHER. AT NO TIME DID THEY CONCEAL THEIR WISH THAT LUIS MAIRA PRESIDE OVER THE NEW PARTY.     THE PLENUM OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY [PS]-ALMEYDA WAS, OF COURSE, THE MOST EAGERLY ANTICIPATED. AS ON OTHER OCCASIONS, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO SET THE TONE FOR THE JOCKEYING BY THE LEFT. THEY AMBITIOUSLY FELT THAT THIS WAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE SOME STRATEGIC OBSTACLES, SORT OF LIKE KILLING TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE: REGISTRATION AND THE SOUGHT-AFTER SOCIALIST UNITY.     PERHAPS THIS IS WHY THEY HELD THEIR PLENUM, WHERE ON 28 AND 29 OCTOBER THEY DISCUSSED THE ADVANTAGES OF REGISTERING THEIR OWN PARTY, IN OTHER WORDS, RESPONDING ONCE AND FOR ALL TO THE INITIATIVES OF THE NUNEZES, WHO TOOK OVER THE PPD, THE ONLY LEGALLY RECOGNIZED SOCIALIST GROUP.  OTHERS THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE WISER TO PROMOTE A PARTY IN THE \"SOCIALIST SPACE,\" BRING TOGETHER THERE CHRISTIAN LEFT, MAPU-BARRUETO AND THE SMALL SOCIALIST GROUPS THAT STILL EXIST, IN OTHER WORDS, COSONO AS A PARTY. THIS STAND OBVIOUSLY GAVE PRIORITY TO SOMETHING OF A LEADING POLITICAL ROLE AND KEPT THE PC AT A DISTANCE.     THE OPTION OF REGISTERING A BROAD LEFT-WING GROUP WAS ALSO RAISED AT THE PLENUM; TO MANY THIS ENTAILED A CERTAIN \"SACRIFICE\" OF PREDOMINANCE BY THE SOCIALISTS.     THE PS-ALMEYDA ULTIMATELY OPTED FOR A \"CONSENSUS\" VOTE, OF WHOSE PUBLIC VERSION THERE WERE SEVERAL INTERPRETATIONS.  THERE WAS TALK OF \"THE REGISTRATION OF A LEGAL INSTRUMENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SOCIALIST SPACE AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE GRASSROOTS FORCES AND OF THE PROGRESSIVE AND LEFTIST INDEPENDENTS WHO HAVE SO FAR BELONGED TO UNLEGALIZED PARTIES.\" THE INTENTION OF THE SOCIALIST LANGUAGE WAS CLEAR, BUT THE PARTY DID NOT CLOSE RANKS WITH A BROAD LEFT-WING ALLIANCE. THE EMPHASIS WAS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER.     WHAT WAS NOT MADE PUBLIC WAS THAT THE POLITICAL VOTE OF \"THE MORE THAN 50 AND FEWER THAN 100 PARTICIPANTS\" SPOKE OF GIVING PRIORITY TO SOCIALIST LEADERSHIP IN THE NEW PARTY. THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOW FOCUSING ON THIS. [CONTINUED]",

AT 2130 IN THE LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD OF PLATINEDI, A CAR PASSING 2 BLOCKS FROM THE PUBLIC SECURITY SECRETARY OF THE STATE WAS SURROUNDED BY A GROUP OF FEDERAL POLICEMEN ARMED WITH PISTOLS AND MACHINEGUNS.

TO DISGUISE THE ODOR OF THE DRUG THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS PACKED SOME PINEAPPLES AMONG THE PLASTIC BAGS.

IT WAS LEARNED THAT THEY ARE LEOPOLDO GOMES PORTAO AND GENILDE FERNANDES MORAIS, WHO LIVE IN CORUMBA, MATO GROSSO DO SUL.

ACCORDING TO A DIJIN REPORT, THE POLICE INFILTRATED THE INNER STRUCTURE OF THE CAMILO ZAPATA VASQUEZ FAMILY.  THE NOTICIERO DE LAS SIETE NEWSCAST MANAGED TO SHOOT VIDEO FOOTAGE OF THE RAID ON THE LA MARIA FARM ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF BOGOTA.  HERE IS EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE AND A REPORT BY WILLIAM CALDERON:     [BEGIN RECORDING] [CALDERON] ANONYMOUS CALLERS INFORMED THE AUTHORITIES ABOUT LA MARIA FARM, A LUXURIOUS RANCH LOCATED NEAR ASUBA, A FEW KILOMETERS FROM BOGOTA.  AT 1900, A GOES [SPECIAL OPERATIONS GROUP] TEAM SURROUNDED THE RANCH.  AN AGENT MAKES SURE THE MAIN GATE IS NOT ELECTRICALLY WIRED, AND THE DECISION TO FORCIBLY ENTER THE HOUSE IS MADE. THEY ALL COVER ONE ANOTHER AS THEY TAKE THEIR POSITIONS.  THESE MEN ARE PERFECTLY TRAINED FOR THIS SORT OF WORK.  THESE IS A LIGHT INSIDE THE RANCH HOUSE, SO THEY ASSUME SOMEONE IS INSIDE.  TENSION RISES IN VIEW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ARMED CONFRONTATION.  AS HE APPROACHES THE RANCH, THE COMMANDER DECIDES TO STORM IT.  MOMENTS LATER, SEVERAL MEN OPEN THE DOOR WITHOUT OFFERING RESISTANCE AND SURRENDER TO THE AUTHORITIES.     A PATROL ENTERS QUICKLY AND CONTROLS EVERY CORNER OF THE RANCH.  OTHER UNIFORMED MEN SUPPORT THE OPERATION FROM OUTSIDE.  THEY UNSUCCESSFULLY LOOK FOR CACHES.  THESE THREE WORKERS WHO WERE DOING REPAIRS AT THE RANCH WERE DETAINED AS A PRECAUTION IN THE MAIN HALL.  MEANWHILE, THE SEARCH CONTINUES IN OTHER AREAS OF THE HOUSE.  THREE SAFES WERE HIDDEN IN DIFFERENT ROOMS OF THE RANCH HOUSE.  ONE OF THE SAFES WAS BUILT INTO ONE OF THE EIGHT MARBLE-TILED BATHROOMS.  THE HUGE KITCHEN WAS TEMPORARILY AT THE WORKERS' DISPOSAL.  NEAR THE MASTER BEDROOM WAS A LARGE SWIMMING POOL WITH A GROUND-LEVEL WINDOW FROM THE SAUNA AND JACUZZI AREA.  THERE WERE SEVERAL GAME ROOMS AND TENNIS AND SQUASH COURTS IN THE HOUSE.     THE AUTHORITIES NOW HAVE DOCUMENTS AND PHOTOGRAPHS, ALTHOUGH THE RESIDENTS OF THIS LUXURY RANCH HAD LEFT BEFORE THE RAID.     NINETEEN OTHER OPERATIONS WERE SIMULTANEOULSY CONDUCTED IN BOGOTA.  THE AUTHORITIES SAID AFTERWARD THAT THEY FELT THEY HAD DISMANTLED THE BOGOTA CARTEL.     THE DIJIN RELEASED THE FOLLOWING REPORT: 10 PERSONS ARRESTED, INCLUDING JESUS EVELIO ZAPATA LOPEZ, THE ALLEGED HEAD OF THIS DRUG TRAFFICKING BAND THAT HAD INTERNATIONAL CONNECTIONS.     THE FOLLOWING WAS SEIZED: 3 CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT WORTH ALMOST 250 MILLION PESOS; 1 1977 PORSCHE SIMILAR TO THE ONE SEIZED FROM JORGE LUIS OCHOA IN 1988; 3 TOYOTAS, ONE OF WHICH WAS SOLD 4 MONTHS AGO BY AN ECUADORAN EMBASSY OFFICIAL IN BOGOTA; 3 REVOLVERS; 3 PISTOLS; 1 CARBINE; AMMUNITION; RADIO COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT; 2 FALSE DIPLOMATIC LICENCE PLATES; AND CASH.

DUARTE MADE THIS CALL DURING HIS SPEECH OPENING THE 13TH INTERNATIONAL FAIR OF EL SALVADOR, IN WHICH 25 COUNTRIES ARE PARTICIPATING.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [DUARTE] I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PEACE LOVER, AND THAT IS WHY IT GRIEVES ME TO SEE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CURRENT SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND CRISIS. I, HOWEVER, BELIEVE THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WILL BE STRENGTHENED. I BELIEVE THE MINDS OF MEN WILL BE TRANSFORMED POSITIVELY, AND IDEOLOGICAL STRUGGLES--EVEN THE MOST POLARIZED ONES--WILL BE DEFINITELY SOLVED BY THE CIVILIZED MEANS OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.     I CALL ON ALL POLITICAL PARTIES TO STRENGTHEN THE CURRENT POLITICAL PROCESS AND PUT THE SACRED INTERESTS OF THE NATION BEFORE ANY OTHER INTERESTS BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO PROTECT THE REPUBLIC AND CONSOLIDATE THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION THAT BELONGS TO ALL SALVADORANS.     I ALSO WANT TO MAKE A CALL TO ALL GROUPS SO THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, WHICH WILL CULMINATE WITH THE ELECTION OF A NEW PRESIDENT NEXT YEAR, DEVELOPS WITH THE SPIRITUAL GRANDEUR THAT CORRESPONDS TO COURAGEOUS PEOPLE, WHO WISH TO SHOW THE WORLD THEIR POLITICAL MATURITY AND THEIR DESIRE TO LIVE IN PEACE.     THE ELECTORAL PROCESS WILL SLOWLY CONSOLIDATE. I BELIEVE SOONER THAN LATER, GOOD JUDGEMENT WILL PREVAIL IN THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DRIVEN MAD BY BARBARISM.

[BEGIN RECORDING] [DUARTE] IT IS TRUE THAT THE ENEMIES OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE WILL GO ON CONDUCTING THEIR TERRORIST AND DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS. THOSE ACTIONS, HOWEVER, WILL NOT AT ALL AFFECT THE PROGRESS MADE BY OUR DEMOCRATIC STRUGGLE. THE TRUTH IS THAT OUR CRISIS IS AS LARGE AS THE EFFORT WE HAVE MADE TO FACE IT. THAT EFFORT GOES BEYOND OUR BORDERS AND REACHES THE ENTIRE WORLD.     THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CHANGES THAT BEGAN TO TAKE PLACE IN EL SALVADOR ARE [WORD INDISTINCT] AND HAVE BEGAN TO SHOW THEIR RESULTS, DESPITE THE DESPERATE ACTIONS THE FMLN-FDR IS CONDUCTING ABROAD IN ORDER TO COUNTER THE RESULTS OF THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE.     THE FOREIGNERS WHO CAME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS FAIR AS WELL AS THE DISTINGUISHED OAS GENERAL ASSEMBLY DELEGATES WILL CONFIRM THAT THE SALVADORAN SITUATION IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THAT CIRCULATED ABROAD AND DISSEMINATED AS PART OF AN FMLN -FDR DISINFORMATION PLAN.     THE REPRESENTATIVES OF OUR LOCAL SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENTS HAVE SAID ABROAD THAT THERE IS REPRESSION IN EL SALVADOR.  ONLY A GOVERNMENT THAT IMPOSES ITSELF BY FORCE ON ITS PEOPLE CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A REPRESSIVE GOVERNMENT. OUR COUNTRY NEVER ENJOYED SO MUCH FREEDOM AS NOW AND ITS RULERS WERE NEVER CHOSEN SO FREELY AS THEY ARE NOW.

CRISTIANI BEGINS BY SAYING THAT THIS IS HIS FIRST REPORT TO THE NATION AFTER 50 DAYS AS PRESIDENT.  HE NOTES THAT SINCE HE ASSUMED POWER ON 1 JUNE, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT HAS INCREASED ITS LEVEL OF VIOLENCE AND ITS NUMBER OF \"INDISCRIMINATE KILLINGS.\"  HE SAYS THAT THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS SINCE HE EXPRESSED ON 1 JUNE HIS DESIRE FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY.     CRISTIANI SAYS THAT SINCE 1 JUNE HE HAS REPEATEDLY CALLED FOR A PEACE DIALOGUE, ADDING:  \"IN ORDER TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE OF THIS NATURE, IT MUST BE HELD IN TWO PHASES:  NATURALLY, DURING THE FIRST PHASE BOTH SIDES MUST SIT DOWN TO DISCUSS THE MECHANISMS TO DEVELOP THAT DIALOGUE PROCESS, A TIMETABLE FOR THE TALKS, AND THE PLACE WHERE THE TALKS WILL BE HELD.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE FIRST PHASE WILL BE TO DETERMINE HOW THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WILL TAKE PLACE.  THE SECOND PHASE -- ONCE AN AGREEMENT IS REACHED ON HOW THE DIALOGUE WILL BE HELD -- IS WHAT WILL BE DISCUSSED.  IN THAT REGARD, OUR GOVERNMENT HAS NOT SET ANY CONDITIONS.  WE ARE WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY TOPIC, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE MUST FIND SOLUTIONS TO MANY THINGS, AND WE ARE WILLING TO DO SO.  THE ONLY CONDITION WE HAVE DEMANDED FOR THIS DIALOGUE PROCESS IS THAT, ONCE IT BEGINS, IT SHOULD NOT BE INTERRUPTED FOR ANY REASON.  WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WANT PEACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND WE CANNOT HOLD TALKS FOR YEARS.  ONCE WE SIT DOWN TO TALK, THAT DIALOGUE SHOULD CONTINUE UNTIL AN OVERALL SOLUTION IS FOUND TO THE CONFLICT.  THAT IS OUR GOVERNMENT'S POSITION, AND WE MAINTAIN THAT POSITION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS THE MOST LOGICAL ONE.\"     TURNING TO ECONOMIC MATTERS, CRISTIANI SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO SOLVE THREE PROBLEMS:  THE FISCAL DEFICIT, INFLATION, AND UNEMPLOYMENT.  HE SAYS THAT AS A FIRST STEP TO BEGIN THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS TO REFORM THE GOVERNMENT'S PRICING POLICY, ADDING:  \"WE MUST PROTECT LOW-INCOME GROUPS, AND FOR THIS REASON WE HAVE ASKED THE ECONOMY MINISTER TO BEGIN A PROCESS AIMED AT ELIMINATING PRICE CONTROLS.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ELIMINATE PRICE CONTROLS ON 230 PRODUCTS WITHOUT HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE MAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC AND THAT WE CAN KEEP STAPLE PRODUCTS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE ECONOMY MINISTRY.\"  HE SAYS THAT PRICE CONTROLS ON STAPLES LIKE BASIC GRAINS, POWDERED MILK, FLOUR, COFFEE, SUGAR, VEGETABLE OIL AND LARD, CEMENT FOR HOUSING, AND OIL BY-PRODUCTS WILL NOT BE ELIMINATED.     REGARDING THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"WE AGREED WITH THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TO DEREGULATE THE DIFFERENTIAL SERVICE. TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE SERVING LOW-INCOME SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION WHILE CHARGING CURRENT FARES, WE WILL ALSO ALLOW THEM TO OFFER THE HIGHER-PRICED SERVICE.  IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHAT KIND OF SERVICE THEY WANT TO USE: WHETHER THEY CONTINUE TO USE THE LOW-PRICED SERVICE OR A BETTER, MORE COMFORTABLE, AND FASTER SERVICE.\"     ON ELECTRICITY RATES, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"WE FEEL THAT ADJUSTMENTS TO ELECTRICITY RATES SHOULD BE APPLIED AS A RESULT OF POWER THAT IS WASTED, THAT IS, BECAUSE IT IS POWER THAT IS BEING CONSUMED BEYOND WHAT IS NEEDED TO LIVE NORMALLY.  THE INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY RATES WILL BE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY IN EACH HOME.  WE BELIEVE THAT WITH THIS INITIAL MEASURE, THE CEL [LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION] SOLVE PROBLEMS.\"     TURNING TO OTHER ECONOMIC MEASURES, CRISTIANI SAYS:  \"WE HAVE TO TAKE SHORT-TERM MEASURES TOO.  IN THIS RESPECT, THE MOST LOGICAL STEP IS TO TAKE MEASURES THAT WILL AFFECT CONSUMPTION AND NOT REVENUES. THUS, WE HAVE ASKED THE FINANCE MINISTER TO TAKE MEASURES RELATED TO TAXES.  HE IS TO CONSOLIDATE TAX PAYMENTS AND ONLY EXEMPT THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BASIC BREAD BASKET ITEMS FROM THE PRESENT 5-PERCENT TAX.  WE HAVE TO START ELIMINATING TAX EXEMPTIONS.  ONLY EXPORTS SHOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF MONETARY INCENTIVE BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING ITS EXPORTS.  THE REST OF THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC SECTORS SHOULD BE TAXED AT THE SAME RATE.\"     CRISTIANI ADDS:  \"WE ARE GOING TO MODIFY THE SYSTEM OF PAYING INCOME TAX.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS BASED ON UNJUST REGULATIONS, ON REVENUES EARNED THE PREVIOUS YEAR THAT DO NOT REFLECT A FIRM'S PRESENT SITUATION.  THUS, WE ARE GOING TO REQUEST THAT INCOME-TAX PAYMENTS BE BASED ON A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRM'S PRESENT SALES; THESE ARE A TRUER AND MORE ACCURATE REFLECTION OF A FIRM'S INCOME.\"     CRISTIANI SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY'S MONETARY POLICY MUST BE AIMED AT INCREASING SAVINGS TO PROMOTE DOMESTIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  HE SAYS THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE INTEREST RECEIVED ON SAVINGS ACCOUNTS IN THE COUNTRY'S BANKS MORE ATTRACTIVE SO THAT CAPITAL DOES NOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY. REGARDING THE COUNTRY'S CURRENCY, CRISTIANI SAYS:  \"WE FEEL THAT CURRENCY VALUE SHOULD BE BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF AND DEMAND FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE.  WE DO NOT THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ARBITRARILY DEVALUE AND FIX AN EXCHANGE RATE ON THE SALVADORAN COLON. EVERYTHING MUST BE BASED ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE OUR COUNTRY MAY HAVE TO PAY OUT FOR IMPORTS, BECAUSE IF WE WERE TO FIX THE RATE AT 10 [COLONES] TO 1 [DOLLAR], THE CENTRAL BANKS STILL WOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH FOREIGN EXCHANGE TO COVER ALL THE IMPORTERS' DEMANDS.\"     FURTHER DETAILS AS AVAILABLE.",

THE EXTREMISTS, ALL CHILEAN NATIONALS SELECTED FROM FPMR MEMBERS, FIRST COMPLETED THEIR THEORETICAL TRAINING IN GUERRILLA WARFARE IN CUBA BEFORE TRAVELING TO ANGOLA WITH CUBAN TROOPS.

HAVING FINISHED THEIR PRACTICAL TRAINING IN A COUNTRY WHERE APPROXIMATELY 50,000 TROOPS ARE STATIONED, THESE FPMR TERRORISTS RETURNED TO CUBA, FROM WHERE THEY TRAVELED TO EUROPE, BEFORE FINALLY RETURNING TO CHILEAN TERRITORY.
