ATTENTION: THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT HAS SUSPENDED ITS AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.     SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTER LUIS YANEZ [AS HEARD] REPORTED TODAY THAT SPAIN HAS SUSPENDED AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT UNTIL THE KILLINGS OF THE SPANISH JESUITS, WHO HAD BEEN LIVING IN OUR COUNTRY FOR YEARS, ARE RESOLVED.     THIS REPORT REPRESENTS A SERIOUS POLITICAL SETBACK FOR THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.  THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S DECISION FURTHER ISOLATES THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WHICH IS ALREADY UNDER PRESSURE BECAUSE OF CALLS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SUSPENSION OF MILITARY AID.  THIS SUSPENSION REPRESENTS A HALT IN THE DELIVERY OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT TO SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.     THIS REPRESENTS INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.  THE INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION OF THE CRISTIANI REGIME IS GROWING.",

SHE HAS DESCRIBED U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CASOLO AS AN ERP [PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY] MEMBER IN CHARGE OF LOGISTICS.     AS HAS BEEN REPORTED, CASOLO WAS RELEASED BY A MILITARY JUDGE AFTER HE DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE AGAINST HER.  SOME GROUPS, HOWEVER, ASSERT THAT CASOLO WAS RELEASED DUE TO POLITICAL PRESSURE FROM THE UNITED STATES, WHICH THREATENED TO LAUNCH A WORLDWIDE CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT EL SALVADOR IF CASOLO WAS NOT RELEASED.     AGUILAR MARROQUIN WAS ARRESTED AT 1500 ON 9 DECEMBER AFTER HAVING PARTICIPATED IN AN ATTACK ON AN URBAN PUBLIC BUS NEAR JUAN PABLO II BOULEVARD.     THE WOMAN FLED AND SOUGHT REFUGE INSIDE THE FACILITIES OF THE SALVADORAN ALBERTO MASFERRER UNIVERSITY, WHERE SHE TOOK A GROUP OF STUDENTS AS HOSTAGES, THREATENING THEM WITH HAND GRENADES. THE POLICE PREVENTED HER FROM DOING ANYTHING AND ARRESTED HER, CONFISCATING ONE .45-CALIBER PISTOL, BULLETS, CARTRIDGES, AND TWO FRAGMENTATION GRENADES.     AGUILAR MARROQUIN SAID THAT SHE JOINED THE ERP LAST MARCH AND THAT SHE WAS PART OF AN URBAN COMMANDO CALLED WORKERS JUSTICE COMMAND. AGUILAR ADDED THAT SHE KNOWS U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CASOLO, WHO BELONGS TO THE ERP, AND THAT CASOLO USED TO MEET WITH TERRORIST LEADER FERNANDO, WORKERS JUSTICE COMMAND OPERATIONS CHIEF, NEAR THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY (UES).     AGUILAR ADDED THAT CASOLO WAS IN CHARGE OF ERP LOGISTICS, ESPECIALLY LODGING PEOPLE AND TRANSPORTING ARMS AND WAR EQUIPMENT. THE ERP HAD GIVEN HER TWO MINIBUSES FOR HER TO CARRY OUT HER TASKS.     IN ADDITION, AGUILAR SAID THAT SHE BELIEVES CASOLO HAD A LEADING POSITION WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION, BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO MEETING WITH FERNANDO, SHE ALSO MET WITH AN INDIVIDUAL KNOWN AS MINCHO, WHO IS THE POLITICAL-MILITARY ERP METROPOLITAN CHIEF AND ALSO THE CHIEF OF THE SO-CALLED URBAN COMMANDOS.     THE PRISONER KNEW ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE ARMS IN CASOLO'S HOUSE, BECAUSE ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS AGUILAR'S CHIEF, KNOWN AS MIRIAM, TOLD HER ABOUT IT. OTHER TERRORISTS WENT TO CASOLO'S HOUSE TO GET WEAPONS, AMMUNITION, AND EXPLOSIVES TO CONDUCT THEIR SABOTAGE OPERATIONS AGAINST BUSES, TELEPHONE DISTRIBUTION BOXES, POWER PYLONS, OR TO CONDUCT LARGE OPERATIONS--AS AGUILAR DESCRIBED THEM-- SUCH AS ATTACKS ON MILITARY GARRISONS.     ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION OBTAINED, THE PRISONER WILL BE SENT TO COURT OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.",

IT DAMAGED WINDOWS OF THE BUILDINGS ON THE BLOCK.     JOSE PARADA GRANDY, THE BOLIVIAN POLICE CHIEF, TOLD EFE THAT AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSON STEPPED OUT OF A VEHICLE AND PLACED A PACKAGE IN ONE OF THE PLANT POTS ON JUAN DE LA RIVA STREET, A FEW METERS FROM THE U.S. EMBASSY IN DOWNTOWN LA PAZ.     PARADA SAID: \"THE VEHICLE LEFT AND IMMEDIATELY THE CHARGE WENT OFF CAUSING CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE.\"     THE \"ZARATE WILLKA ARMED FORCES OF LIBERATION,\" A GROUP WITH AN INDIAN BAKCGROUND, HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK IN A COMMUNIQUE THAT WAS SENT TO SOME MEDIA.

I THEREFORE WANTED TO CONVEY A MESSAGE OF HOPE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO EVERY CHILEAN, TO SHOW THEM MY FEELINGS AT THIS TIME OF DEEP REFLECTION.     FROM THE VERY MOMENT I LEARNED ABOUT THIS TERRORIST ECONOMIC AGGRESSION, I ORDERED THE CREATION OF FOUR MINISTERIAL COMMISSIONS TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM. I ALSO SENT TWO MINISTERS TO THE UNITED STATES TO MEET WITH U.S.  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. AFTER TIRING SESSIONS OF TALKS, THESE MINISTERS MANAGED TO OVERCOME A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE GRAPE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM AFFECTING OTHER FRUITS REMAINS TO BE SOLVED.     THIS NEW ATTACK AGAINST THE CHILEAN NATION, AN ATTACK THAT DESTINY HAS PLACED IN THE NATION'S PATH OF FREEDOM, PROGRESS, AND WELL-BEING, COMPELS US TO CLOSE RANKS BEHIND THE GOVERNMENT, UNIFIED AND READY TO FIGHT -- WITH COURAGE AND HIGH SPIRIT -- THE PROBLEM THAT FACES US.     ON THIS OCCASION THE COUNTRY HAS SEEN HOW THE COUNTLESS THREATS TO BOYCOTT THE NATIONAL ECONOMY HAVE WORKED. MOST OF THE TIME SUCH THREATS HAVE BEEN PROMOTED BY CERTAIN POLITICIANS, LABOR LEADERS, OR COMMUNIST LABOR UNIONS, BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO -- DRIVEN BY PERSONAL OR IDEOLOGICAL INTEREST -- HAVE CONTINUALLY JEOPARDIZED THE STABILITY OF WORKERS, OF FAMILIES, AND OF THOSE WHOM THEY DEMAGOGICALLY CALL THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN. THEY DO NOT CARE IF THEY CAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT, POVERTY, AND HUNGER TO 500,000 FELLOW CITIZENS WHO WORK IN THIS AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY.     HOW SHAMELESSLY THEY MAKE CLAIMS AND DEMANDS, OFFERING THEIR SUPPORT AND THEIR SOLIDARITY WHEN CHILE IS SERIOUSLY THREATENED! YET WHEN THE DANGER IS OVER, THEY CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE AND AGAIN LEVEL CHARGES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND CRITICIZE ITS ACTIONS. IN DOING THAT THEY FAIL TO RECALL THAT FROM ITS VERY BEGINNING THE CHILEAN NATION HAS BEEN BUILT UPON NON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ESSENCE OF THE NATIONAL SOUL.     GENTLEMEN: OUR WILL IS BASED ON OUR FEELING OF UNITY IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY, WHETHER FROM THE ACTION OF NATURE OR FROM THE ACTION OF TREACHEROUS, DISTURBED MINDS THAT RECOGNIZE NO MORAL VALUES, FATHERLAND, OR LAW.     CHILEANS: A FEW DAYS AGO I REPORTED ON THE STEPS FORWARD IN THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION PROCESS AND ON THE PROGRESS THAT OUR COUNTRY HAS MADE IN ALL FIELDS.     THE FACT THAT CYANIDE HAS BEEN INJECTED INTO TWO EXPORTED GRAPES HAS CAUSED INCALCULABLE DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY; IT HAS ALSO BROUGHT THE SHADOW OF ANGUISH AND UNCERTAINTY TO THOUSANDS OF HOMES OF FELLOW COUNTRYMEN WHOSE JOBS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO A LIVELIHOOD HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY JEOPARDIZED. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT SOME OFFICIALS OF IMPORTING COUNTRIES, WITHOUT WEIGHING THE TRUE EFFECTS OF THIS TYPE OF MEASURE, HAVE RESTRICTED THE IMPORT OF CHILEAN FRUITS, THUS PROVOKING FEAR AND DISTRUST ON THE INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER MARKET. GENTLEMEN, WE MUST REVERSE THIS SITUATION.     WE SHOULD ONCE AGAIN ACT IN A UNITED MANNER TO RECOVER INTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE AND OUR UNDISPUTED LEADERSHIP AS EXPORTERS. I AM SURE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED WITH A NEW JOINT EFFORT. [CONTINUED]",

    "doctext": "SAN SALVADOR, 22 APR 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] DEAR RADIO AUDIENCE: FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TALK TO YOU TONIGHT ABOUT A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY.  MANY TIMES YOU HAVE HEARD US MENTION THE WORD SOLIDARITY.  WE HAVE ALWAYS USED IT AS A WORD THAT MEANS TO THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO SUFFER THE MOST, THOSE WHO HAVE LESS.  INDEED, THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE MUST HELP, EVEN WITH OUR OWN SACRIFICE, AND MANY TIMES WITH A HUGE SACRIFICE BY ALL OF US.  IF LOVE IS THE BOND THAT UNITES FAMILY MEMBERS, SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE GREAT PILLAR, THE CEMENT THAT UNITES SALVADORAN SOCIETY, SO THAT, UNITED, WE MAY FULFILL OUR DESIRE FOR PEACE, TRANQUILITY, HAPPINESS, AND WELL-BEING.     HOWEVER, TONIGHT ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE CONSIDER SHOULD BE THE USE OF THE WORD SOLIDARITY AND WHAT THIS WORD MEANS IN MATTERS THAT ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER.  A FEW WEEKS AGO THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OIL PRICES, TO RAISE THE PRICE OF OIL BYPRODUCTS SUCH AS GASOLINE, DIESEL, AND ALL FUELS.  IN THE PAST, THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE. PERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT DID THIS TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS WOULD HAVE NOTHING BUT POSITIVE EFFECTS.  HOWEVER, LET US ANALYZE FOR A WHILE THE ISSUE OF INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF FUEL.  WHEN A GOVERNMENT HAS NO MONEY FOR SUBSIDIZING, THAT MEANS THE COST OF LIVING WILL GO UP. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT PRICES WILL RISE WHEN A GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE THAN WHAT IT HAS.  HOWEVER, LET US SEE HOW THIS ASPECT, OR RATHER THE PRINCIPLE OF SOLIDARITY, APPLIES TO THE INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES, ESPECIALLY THE PRICE OF GASOLINE.     TEN PERCENT OF ALL FAMILIES IN OUR COUNTRY OWN A VEHICLE.  IN GENERAL, THAT 10 PERCENT ARE THOSE WHO HAVE THE MOST; IN OTHER WORDS, THOSE WHO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF BUYING A CAR, A VEHICLE.  IF WE SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE, WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING IS TAKING MONEY OUT OF A GOVERNMENT THAT, FOR THE TIME BEING, DOES NOT HAVE SUCH FUNDS AVAILABLE.  IN ORDER TO GET SUCH FUNDS, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO IMPOSE NEW TAXES WHICH WOULD AFFECT ALL SALVADORANS.  THEREFORE, LET US THINK WHETHER OR NOT IT IS FAIR THAT 90 PERCENT OF ALL SALVADORAN FAMILIES, WHO OWN NO VEHICLES, MUST PAY SOME KIND OF TAX IN ORDER TO BENEFIT THE OTHER 10 PERCENT WHO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT ALLOW THEM TO BUY A VEHICLE.     WE DO NOT WANT TO APPEAR AS DEMAGOGIC OR POPULIST WITH THIS EXAMPLE.  WHAT WE WANT TO SAY IS THAT THOSE OF US WHO OWN A VEHICLE, WHO ARE PART OF THE 10 PERCENT LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SOMETHING AND THUS CAN BUY A VEHICLE, MUST BE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THAT 90 PERCENT WHO HAVE LITTLE AND MANY TIMES NOTHING.  THEY HAVE NO VEHICLES, AND THEREFORE HAVE NO REASON TO SUFFER SO THE GASOLINE WE BUY BECOMES CHEAPER. MOREOVER, TO SOME EXTENT THE CURRENT PRICE OF GASOLINE MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR THE DIESEL SUPPLIED TO URBAN AND INTERURBAN BUS COMPANIES TO BE BOUGHT AT A PRICE THAT WILL ALLOW BUS OWNERS TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT BUS FARES.  THIS IS SOLIDARITY, AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT. THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOMETHING, WHO OWN A VEHICLE, PAY SOMETHING -- THROUGH THE PRICE OF THE GASOLINE WE CONSUME -- SO THAT THOSE WHO OWN NOTHING AND MUST USE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION BUSES CAN DO SO WITH NO PRICE INCREASE.     THE SAME SHOULD BE THE CASE FOR THE COST OF LIQUID GAS AND PROPANE GAS, SO THAT THE PRICES OF FOOD COOKED WITH GAS IN THE MARKETPLACES ARE NOT INCREASED.  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOMETHING CAN SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE LITTLE OR NOTHING AT ALL.     I WOULD NOW LIKE TO TALK ABOUT AN EXAMPLE OF AN EVEN DEEPER KIND OF SOLIDARITY.  I WANT TO TALK ABOUT PEACE.  SALVADORAN BROTHERS, THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE MOTHERS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR SONS.  WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THE INNOCENT CHILDREN WHO COULD KICK A MINE AND END UP WITHOUT AN ARM OR A LEG.  WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO, BECAUSE OF VIOLENCE, CANNOT FIND A JOB.  THAT IS WHY THIS IS THE TIME FOR ALL OF US TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO ACHIEVE PEACE.     LAST THURSDAY I TOLD YOU I FELT MORE OPTIMISTIC AFTER MEETING WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND LISTENING TO THEIR DECISION TO ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE TO WORK FOR PEACE.  THEY ARE DETERMINED TO REACH A CONSENSUS TO FULFILL THE ASPIRATIONS OF ALL SALVADORANS.  WE ARE BEGINNING TO SENSE WHAT THE NEAR FUTURE OF EL SALVADOR COULD BE.  WE ARE FEELING HAPPY AND OPTIMISTIC.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT, THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE SHOULD ALL CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE.     ANYTHING THAT MAY LEAD TO VIOLENCE, WHETHER IT IS STREET DISTURBANCES OR BOMBS, SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED, BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER CONCEIVABLE FOR MOTHERS, CHILDREN, AND FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TO SUFFER IN OUR COUNTRY.  THE TIME HAS COME TO SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY, TO SEARCH, NOT ONLY THROUGH WORDS BUT ALSO THROUGH OUR EXAMPLES AND ACTIONS, FOR THE PEACE THAT OUR COUNTRY AND SALVADORANS DESERVE.     THEREFORE, OUR SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR OUR COUNTRY'S RECONSTRUCTION.  IT SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR THE PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL RECONSTRUCTION OF ALL SALVADORANS.  WE WANT ALL SALVADORANS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, TO SUPPORT THE PEACE EFFORTS, SO THAT THOSE WHO SUFFER SO VERY MUCH FROM VIOLENCE WILL NO LONGER SUFFER.     THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL STEP FORWARD FOR THE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  SALVADORAN BROTHERS, LET US SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY IN THIS CRUCIAL TIME IN OUR HISTORY, BECAUSE WE HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT WHEN ALL SALVADORANS ACT POSITIVELY LIKE BROTHERS, WE CAN COME OUT AHEAD.  THIS IS ALL FOR TONIGHT.  THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU.",

THE BLAST FROM THE EXPLOSION HIT A TRUCK FULL OF POLICEMEN, WHO HAD EARLIER CARRIED OUT AN ANTI-MAFIA OPERATION IN A PEASANT VILLAGE, AS WELL AS SEVERAL PUBLIC BUSES, HOUSES, AND BUSINESSES.     A POLICE EXPERT SAID THAT THE CAR BOMB (CONTAINING 300 KG OF DYNAMITE) WAS ACTIVATED BY REMOTE CONTROL AS THE ELITE FORCE PATROL PASSED BY.     ACCORDING TO GOMEZ MARTINEZ, \"THESE ACTIONS WILL ONLY CEASE WHEN (PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS') GOVERNMENT PUTS ASIDE SO MUCH PREJUDICE AND AGREES TO THE PEACE TALKS,\" PROPOSED BY THE SUBVERSIVES.     \"THE DIALOGUE WILL TAKE PLACE SONNER OR LATER, AND IT IS BETTER TO START NOW,\" INSISTED THE MAYOR OF MEDELLIN, A CITY WHERE THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL CARTEL HAS ITS BASE OF OPERATIONS.     THE CHIEF OF THE CRIMINAL GANG, PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, ORDERED THE ASSASSINATION OF MEDELLIN POLICEMEN IN RETALIATION FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTION AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  TWENTY-EIGHT POLICEMEN HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THIS CITY OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS.     ACCORDING TO SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS, YESTERDAY'S ATTACK \"COULD BE ESCOBAR GAVIRIA'S RESPONSE TO THE ARREST OF ADOLFO MESA MENESES,\" HIS RIGHT-HAND MAN.     MESA MENESES WAS ARRESTED LAST WEEK BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS, SECRET POLICE), AND THE AUTHORITIES HAVE ACCUSED HIM OF ASSASSINATING -- ON ORDERS FROM THE MAFIA LEADER -- LEFTIST PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, AS WELL AS A CHIEF OF POLICE, A MAYOR, AND SEVERAL JOURNALISTS.     MEANWHILE, HUNDREDS OF SOLDIERS, POLICEMEN, AND DETECTIVES ARE CARRYING OUT LARGE-SCALE OPERATIONS IN THE COLOMBIAN COUNTRYSIDE AND BORDER AREAS ON THE SUSPICION THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA PLANS TO FLEE THE COUNTRY.     LAST NIGHT, A TELEVISION NEWSCAST SHOWED PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE \"DRUG LORD\" THAT HAD BEEN \"RECENTLY\" TAKEN BY SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS AT A COLOMBIAN BEACH ON THE PACIFIC COAST.     A POLICE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN CONFIRMED TODAY THAT \"WE HAVE RELIABLE INFORMATION ON HIS WHEREABOUTS,\" ALTHOUGH HE REFRAINED FROM GIVING FURTHER DETAILS.  UNOFFICIAL SOURCES SAID THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA \"IS SOMEWHERE IN WESTERN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT\" -- OF WHICH MEDELLIN IS THE CAPITAL -- WHERE THE SEARCH OPERATIONS ARE CONCENTRATED.     COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO ASKED FOR THE COOPERATION OF BRAZIL, ECUADOR, PANAMA, PERU, AND VENEZUELA TO STOP THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS FROM ESCAPING TO THOSE COUNTRIES.",

ANOTHER GANG IS LED BY GERSON PALERMO, OF UMUARAMA, PARANA STATE, WHO CONTROLS THE EXCHANGE OF COCAINE TO PARAGUAY FOR STOLEN BRAZILIAN CARS.  PALERMO OWNS FOUR TWIN-ENGINED CESSNA PLANES AND EMPLOYS MORE THAN 200 MEN.  HE ALSO EXCHANGE CARS FOR COCAINE IN BOLIVIA.  ALTHOUGH SENTENCED BY THE BRAZILIAN COURTS, PALERMO LIVES IN PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO, PARAGUAY, WHERE HE MAINTAINS BUSINESS CONTACTS WITH THE BOLIVIAN COCA PRODUCERS. PALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR REFINING THE DRUG, FROM ARGENTINA.     THE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVES THAT THE DRUG MIGHT BE REFINED IN MATO GROSSO DO SUL, NEAR SOME RESIDENCES IN THE DOURADOS AND CAMPO GRANDE SECTORS.  PALERMO EXCHANGES THE CHEMICALS FOR TONS OF COCAINE PASTE WHICH, IN THE OPINION OF REGIONAL FEDERAL POLICE DELEGATE FRANCISCO VIANA QUEIROZ, IS ALSO PROCESSED IN PARAGUAY.  VIANA QUEIROZ MAINTAINS THAT THE DRUG IS REFINED BY A GROUP OF TRAFFICKERS LED BY ARSENIO BENITEZ GONZALEZ, WHO IS KNOWN AS VILHAR AND WHO LIVES IN ASUNCION. THE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVE THAT VILHAR -- WHO IS BELIEVED TO BE PALERMO'S PARTNER -- IS THE BRAZILIAN TRAFFICKERS' MAIN COCAINE SUPPLIER.     ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, TWO DRUG ROUTES PASS THROUGH MATO GROSSO DO SUL: THE PONTA PORA ROUTE (WHICH IS USED BY PALERMO), AND THE CORUMBA ROUTE, WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE BOLIVIAN TOWN OF PUERTO SUAREZ.  MANY TRAFFICKERS COME TO THIS BOLIVIAN TOWN, MOST OF THEM SMALL SUPPLIERS WHO ONLY WANT TO EXCHANGE COCAINE FOR CARS THAT WERE STOLEN IN BRAZIL.  ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, THE CORUMBA ROUTE IS MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT CHANNELS THE SO-CALLED \"MINI-TRAFFIC.\"  THIS INVOLVES HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO, TOGETHER, MAKE UP A SIZABLE QUANTITY OF DRUGS EVERY DAY.     THE CARS ARE THE HARD CURRENCY USED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS.  MOST OF THEM ARE TAKEN TO BOLIVIA AFTER HAVING BEEN STOLEN IN SAO PAULO.  THEY FOLLOW THE SAME ROUTE AS THE BOLIVIAN COCAINE, THAT IS, VIA PUERTO SUAREZ.  THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE TRAFFICKING, HOWEVER, IS CARRIED OUT IN PARAGUAY AND BOLIVIA.  GERSON PALERMO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PART OF IT, WHILE THE REST IS SHARED BY HUNDREDS OF BOLIVIAN TRAFFICKERS.  PALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE FROM FORMOSA, ARGENTINA.  HE TAKES THESE CHEMICALS ABOARD SMALL PLANES TO THE TOWNS OF PILAR OR ENCARNACION, IN PARAGUAY. FROM THERE, ANOTHER GROUP TAKES THE 200-LITER DRUMS ALONG THE CHACO HIGHWAY TO PUERTO GUARANI, IN BOLIVIA.  BOLIVIAN TRAFFICKERS TAKE CARE OF THE REST OF THE JOURNEY TO SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA.  IN RETURN, PALERMO RECEIVES COCAINE PASTE WHICH IS SHIPPED TO ASUNCION AND, FROM THERE, TO PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO FOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE PROCESSING UNITS.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE TRAFFICKERS USE SOME RANCHES NEAR PORTO MURTINHO (MATO GROSSO DE SUL), NEAR THE PARAGUAYAN TOWN OF BAHIA NEGRA, TO PROCESS LARGE QUANTITIES OF COCAINE.     NO COCAINE PASTE IS USUALLY AVAILABLE ALONG THE CORUMBA ROUTE.  THE DRUG IS REFINED BECAUSE IT IS RELATIVELY EASY TO FIND ETHER AND ACETONE IN CORUMBA, WHERE THE FEDERAL POLICE HAVE FAILED TO REDUCE THE LARGE DEMAND FOR SUCH CHEMICALS IN RETAIL STORES.  DOZENS OF DRUGSTORES SELL THOSE PRODUCTS BY THE LITER, AND THIS IS NOT FORBIDDEN BY LAW.     THE AUTHORITIES ESTIMATE THAT PRODUCTION IN THE PUERTO SUAREZ REGION NEARS 300 KG PER WEEK, WHICH IS TRANSPORTED BY RAILROAD, AIR, AND LAND.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO EVADE THE FEDERAL POLICE, TRAFFICKERS HAVE TRIED TO TRANSPORT THE DRUG INSIDE THEIR BODIES, IN WINE DEMIJOHNS, AND EVEN IN CHILDREN'S DIAPERS.  THESE TRAFFICKERS GENERALLY TRAVEL BY BUS OR BY TRAIN. OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS THE POLICE CAUGHT DOZENS OF TRAFFICKERS USING THESE METHODS.  NOW, HOWEVER, ONLY WITH THE COMPLICITY OF THE POLICE CAN CARS CARRYING BOLIVIAN COCAINE PRODUCED IN THE PUERTO SUAREZ REGION REACH CAMPO GRANDE.",

PRESIDENT, WHEN ONE SEES PERU FACING THE DIFFICULTIES IT IS EXPERIENCING NOW, THE SAME AS OUR OWN COUNTRY AND LATIN AMERICA IN GENERAL, ONE ASKS HIMSELF: WOULD A MAN, A NOVELIST LIKE MARIO VARGAS LLOSA, BE THE RIGHT MAN TO LEAD PERU?     [GARCIA] AS PRESIDENT OF ALL PERUVIANS -- AND OF VARGAS LLOSA TO EVEN IF HE DOES NOT LIKE IT -- I CANNOT PASS JUDGMENT, EITHER ETHICALLY OR INTELLECTUALLY, ON A POLITICIAN AND PERUVIAN WHO IS CONTENDING FOR THE PRESIDENCY.     [REPORTER] WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO AFTER YOU STEP DOWN FROM THE PRESIDENCY?     [GARCIA] WELL, I AM GOING TO BE FREE.     [AMAT] WHY DO YOU NOT COME TO COLOMBIA AND I AM SURE...     [GARCIA, INTERRUPTING] SURE, I ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION, AND I HOPE SOME COLOMBIANS WILL EXTEND IT.  HOWEVER, I WANT TO TELL YOU VERY HONESTLY, THAT I AM PERHAPS BETTER AT SELLING DREAMS, IDEAS, AND DOCTRINES THAN AT ADMINISTERING A SITUATION OF PENURY, LIKE THE ONE OUR COUNTRIES ARE EXPERIENCING, AND MOST PARTICULARLY PERU, WHICH IS ONE OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA.  IT IS VERY DIFFICULT. FOR INSTANCE, ON A DAY WHEN THE PRICE OF RICE OR CHICKEN GOES UP, THE PEOPLE WILL NOT BELIEVE YOU, EVEN IF YOU TELL THEM THE GREATEST OF TRUTHS.  ONE CAN BE PREACHING SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT, BUT IF IT FAILED TO RAIN AND THE CITY HAD NO WATER NO ONE WILL BELIEVE OF YOU THE GREATEST OF ALL TRUTHS.  THEN, WHEN ONE STOPS BEING PRESIDENT AND ADMINISTERING PENURY, ONE CAN DEVOTE ONESELF TO CONVINCING PEOPLE, TO EDUCATING.  THAT IS WHAT I SHOULD DO.     [AMAT] NOW, WHY DID YOU MAKE THAT ASIDE, MAKING ME PRESIDENT OF ALL PERUVIANS, EVEN OF VARGAS LLOSA?  WHETHER HE LIKES OR NOT IT HURTS HIM.     [GARCIA] BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE ME AS PRESIDENT.  [LAUGHTER]     [AMAT] EVEN HIM, FOR INSTANCE?     [GARCIA] I DID NOT SAY SO.  I DO NOT KNOW.  I NEVER FALL TO THE LEVEL OF DEFINING PEOPLE OR POINTING OUT LAST NAMES.  I MAKE AN OUTLINE OR DEFINE THEM IN THE NEGATIVE.     [AMAT] MR. PRESIDENT, [WORDS INDISTINCT] THIS DIALOGUE [WORDS INDISTINCT] FOR YOUR GENEROSITY AND KINDNESS.  ADDRESSING OUR PEOPLE AND OUR COUNTRY, [WORDS INDISTINCT], HOW WERE THINGS TODAY AT THE SUMMIT?     [GARCIA] VERY WELL.  COLOMBIANS, WHO HAVE SEEN THEIR INSTITUTION THREATENED, THEIR PRESS ABUSED, AND MANY POLITICIANS ALSO THREATENED, MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT LATIN AMERICA, TOGETHER WITH THE UNITED STATES, WILL CONFRONT THE PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THIS IS NOT ONLY A PROBLEM FOR COLOMBIA.  IT IS OUR PROBLEM TOO, AND WE WILL TACKLE IT.  THE DAY A NEWSPAPER WAS BLOWN UP IN BOGOTA I CAME TO BOGOTA BECAUSE I FELT THAT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS WAS THREATENED ON THE CONTINENT.  AFTER ALL, WE ARE LATIN AMERICANS.  LET COLOMBIANS HAVE CONFIDENCE.",

THE NEWSPAPER STATED THAT THE ALLEGED RIFT BETWEEN THE MILITARY OFFICERS BEGAN ONCE IT WAS DISCOVERED WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, IN WHICH ONE COLONEL, TWO LIEUTENANTS, AND SIX SOLDIERS ARE BEING CHARGED.     COLONEL PONCE SAID THAT THE RELATIONS WITH U.S. ADVISERS -- ABOUT 52 IN THE COUNTRY -- ARE VERY CORDIAL.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] OUR RELATIONS WITH THE NORTH AMERICANS ARE NORMAL AS USUAL.  THE U.S. ADVISERS HAVE HELPED US VERY MUCH IN THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND THEY CONTINUE WORKING WITH US.     [REPORTER] WHERE DO YOU THINK THESE WIRE REPORTS STATING THERE ARE RIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN MILITARY OFFICERS AND U.S.  ADVISERS HAVE ORGINIATED?     [PONCE] I DO NOT KNOW; I CANNOT UNDERSTAND.  THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE WHO TRY TO BREAK THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES AND THE UNITED STATES.  THIS IS A POOR COUNTRY THAT DEPENDS A GREAT DEAL ON U.S. ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID.     [REPORTER] FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS, WHAT ARE RELATIONS LIKE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN MILITARY AND THE GRINGO ADVISERS?     [PONCE] AS USUAL, THESE RELATIONS ARE VERY CORDIAL, AND THEY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US.  AS YOU CAN SEE, TWO ADVISERS ARE HERE WITH ME NOW AT THE TABLE PRESIDING OVER THE EVENT.  THE SAME HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH ALL THE UNITS IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR.  I FAIL TO SEE ANY DIFFERENCE IN RELATIONS BEFORE AND AFTERWARD. [END RECORDING]     THE MILITARY CHIEF REPEATED THE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, NOT ONLY DUE TO THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS, BUT ALSO TO KEEP CONTROL OVER THE ORGANIZATION FRONTS JUST PRIOR TO AN EXPECTED WAVE OF PROTESTS ON THE LATEST GOVERNMENT ECONOMY MEASURES.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] WE MUST START THINKING WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO DOMESTIC ORDER IN THE FACE OF THE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED OR ARE PLANNED.  WE MUST THINK WHAT THE REACTION OF THE PEOPLE OR THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] ORGANIZATION FRONTS WILL BE, AS THEY ALWAYS USE ANY EXCUSE TO DISRUPT DOMESTIC ORDER.  IT WOULD BE GOOD TO LOOK INTO WHAT IS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN DOMESTIC ORDER IN THE COUNTRY. [END RECORDING]     THE HIGH-RANKING MILITARY OFFICER GAVE THESE STATEMENTS AT THE CEREMONY TO TURN OVER COMMAND OF THE CAPTAIN GENERAL GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY.  THE NEW COMMANDER IS COLONEL RICARDO ALFONSO CASANOVA SANDOVAL, WHO REPLACES COLONEL GUILLERMO ALFREDO BENAVIDES MORENO, REMOVED FROM HIS POST AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF ORDERING THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.     MEANWHILE, COLONEL HECTOR HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ HAS BEEN APPOINTED COMMANDER OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE BASED IN USULUTAN, AND IN LA UNION DEPARTMENT THE CHANGE OF COMMAND CEREMONIES OF THE ARMED FORCES MILITARY TRAINING CENTER HAVE TAKEN PLACE, WHERE COLONEL FRANCISCO ARTURO LOPEZ WILL BE IN COMMAND REPLACING COLONEL CARLOS ALFREDO RIVAS, WHO HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.",

I WAS WITH HIM HERE YESTERDAY DISCUSSING OTHER THINGS, AS WELL AS MILITARY MATTERS WITH THE DEFENSE MINISTER AND DEPUTY MINISTERS.  HE WAS PRESENT.  UNLESS HE MAY HAVE LEFT.  I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH, BECAUSE I HAD A MEETING WITH THEM TO SEE THE ORDER OF THE MONTH ON SATURDAY AND HE WAS PRESENT.  PARDON ME, THAT WAS TUESDAY WHEN WE HAD THE ORDER FOR THE END OF THE MONTH.  I UNDERSTAND HE WAS PRESENT AT THE COMMANDERS MEETING.  IF HE LEFT LAST WEEKEND, IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR THE WEEKEND AND HE RETURNED ON MONDAY.     [MODERATOR] MARIA CORTINA, NOTIMEX.     [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, IN WHAT WAY WOULD A CUT IN MILITARY AID AFFECT THE PEACE PROCESS?     [CRISTIANI] WE ARE CURRENTLY SEEING OPPOSITE SIGNS FROM THE FMLN IN TERMS OF WANTING TO TRULY PUT AN END TO VIOLENCE.  A SIGN OF THIS WAS THE NIGHT OF 1 MAY WHEN THE ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT.  THIS WOULD INDICATE THAT, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL THE FMLN COMMAND, THAT IS THE FIVE GROUPS, SOME GROUPS SEEM TO RESIST A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND FAVOR A MILITARY SOLUTION, AS THEY HAVE INSISTED ON PURSUING FOR 10 YEARS. THOSE GROUPS COULD VIEW A CUT IN MILITARY AID AS A SIGN OF WEAKENING OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES, AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY THEY WOULD HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF BEING SUCCESSFUL FOLLOWING THE MILITARY PATH.  THAT COULD INCREASE THE POTENTIAL OF A MILITARY SOLUTION IN THE MINDS OF SOME.  THIS COULD REDUCE THE POTENTIAL OF SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.     [MODERATOR] RAUL MONGE, CADENA RADIO CENTRO.     [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, HOW DO YOU VIEW THE GUERRILLAS' MORALE AT THIS MOMENT?     [CRISTIANI] WELL, I OBVIOUSLY CANNOT BUT BELIEVE THAT THE MORALE OF THE GUERRILLAS AFTER THE OFFENSIVE MUST HAVE DROPPED CONSIDERBLY. THIS IS ESPECIALLY SO SINCE THERE WAS A LARGE SACRIFICE ON THEIR PART IN THE FORM OF CASUALTIES AND THE FACT THAT THE OFFENSIVE DID NOT REPRESENT A SUCCESS, DESPITE THEIR CLAIM THAT IT WAS ONLY A SHOW OF FORCE, WHICH IS A LOT OF MALARKEY.  ALL THE PRIOR DOCUMENTS INDICATED THAT THIS WAS A LARGE-SCALE OPERATION TO THE HILT SEEKING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT AND TO CROWN A MILITARY VICTORY.  WHAT I BELIEVE WAS OF EVEN GREATER IMPACT WAS THAT THEY REALIZED THAT THE PEOPLE OF EL SALVADOR DO NOT SUPPORT THEM AND DO NOT SUPPORT THE PATH OF VIOLENCE. IN THAT SENSE, THEIR HOPES OF A POPULAR INSURRECTION WERE SHATTERED. ON THE CONTRARY, THE PEOPLE DID NOT SUPPORT THE FMLN AND INSTEAD TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEM AND SHOWED THAT THEY DO NOT SUPPORT VIOLENCE.  THIS MUST HAVE CAUSED AN IMPACT ON THE FMLN AND ITS MEMBERS.  I RECENTLY READ IN A VENEZUELAN NEWSPAPER STATEMENTS BY A COMMANDER, WHOSE PSEUDONYM IS GUSTAVO, WHO SAID THAT THEY WERE TIRED OF FOLLOWING THE PATH OF VIOLENCE AND THAT A SOLUTION HAD TO BE FOUND. THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT SOME OF THEIR RANKS ARE GETTING TIRED OF THE MILITARY PATH.  THESE ARE INDICATIONS OF WHAT COULD BE.  WHAT I WANT TO CLEAR UP ONCE AND FOR ALL IS THAT WE DO NOT REACT TO WHETHER OR NOT THE FMLN FEELS STRONG OR FEELS WEAK.  WE KNOW THAT 100 TERRORISTS IN A COUNTRY CAN CAUSE DESTRUCTION AND DEATH AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO AVOID, ALTHOUGH 100 TERRORISTS ARE NOT A FORCE THAT WILL DESTABILIZE A GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, THE DAMAGE THAT THEY CAUSE IS SUCH THAT WE DO NOT WANT IT TO CONTINUE.  [CONTINUED]",

PRESS AGENCY REPORTS NOTE THAT THERE IS GREAT TENSION IN THE CAPITAL CITY, AND APPARENTLY THEY ARE EXPECTING [CHANGES THOUGHT] HERE IS A NEWS AGENCY REPORT WHICH SAYS THAT EARLY THIS MORNING, LESS SHOOTING WAS HEARD BECAUSE APPARENTLY EACH SIDE HAD CONSOLIDATED THEIR POSITION.  THAT IS WHAT SOME PRESS AGENCIES ARE REPORTING.     WE HAVE ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ADMITTED THAT SOME AREAS IN THE CAPITAL CITY ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FMLN.  THERE ARE MANY VEHICLES SCATTERED ALL OVER THE STREETS OF SAN SALVADOR.  THAT IS THE REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM SAN SALVADOR, WHERE OUR FIGHTERS IN ZACAMIL AND OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN THE CAPITAL CITY ARE NOW RECEIVING THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FORTIFYING THEMSELVES IN NEIGHBORHOODS.     WE CALL ON THE SAN SALVADORAN YOUTHS TO GO OUT TONIGHT TO COOPERATE WITH THE FMLN FIGHTERS.  MAKE THE ASSASSINS OF MSGR ROMERO PAY DEARLY FOR EVERY STEP THEY TAKE AGAINST THE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN SALVADOR CITY.  IT HAS BEEN 24, 25, NEARLY 26 HOURS SINCE THE FMLN FIGHTERS ESTABLISHED THEIR POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR IN VIEW OF THE REGIME'S INCOMPETENCE.  THE REGIME HAS CLEARLY SAID THAT IT IS INCAPABLE OF CONTROLLING THE SITUATION, AS IT HAS HAD TO DECREE A STATE OF SIEGE THAT BEGAN ON THE EVENING OF 12 NOVEMBER IN SAN SALVADOR.     ANOTHER EVIDENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S WEAKNESS IS THE GAG PLACED ON THE MEDIA.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ALLOWED THE MEDIA TO BROADCAST ITS NEWSCASTS.  WHY DOESN'T THE GOVERNMENT WANT THE PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO NEWSCASTS IN EL SALVADOR?  WHAT IS THE CRISTIANI REGIME HIDING?  THIS IS A QUESTION THAT THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING; THEY WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWER.  THE GOVERNMENT IS AFRAID, IT DOES NOT WANT TO INFORM THE PEOPLE ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTS OR THE SCOPE OF THE ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.     COMRADE FIGHTERS: WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU; THIS IS IN THE BAG. YOUR COURAGE AND DETERMINATION TO WIN HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT THE FMLN PLAN AS OUR COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE GENERAL COMMAND HAS SAID.     COMRADES: KEEP IT UP, KEEP AN OPEN EYE, KEEP UP THE HIGH MORALE AS YOU HAVE DONE UP TO NOW, SEEK CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE, RECEIVE THEIR COOPERATION IN THE FORTIFICATIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE THROUGHOUT SAN SALVADOR.  LET'S GO TO THE TOP AND THAT'S IT.",

HE SAID THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION IS CONTINUING ITS EFFORTS TO FORM A COMMISSION FOR A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS AND THAT HE IS NOW AWAITING WORD FROM TWO PEOPLE WHOM HE HAS CHOSEN TO SERVE ON THE COMMISSION. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED ON THE COMMISSION BECAUSE THE COMMISSION IS COMPLETELY POLITICAL IN NATURE.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF NATIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR COLONEL ROBERTO ARMANDO RIVERA ESCOBAR, WHO WAS KILLED IN A MACHINEGUN ATTACK THIS MORNING.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ATTRIBUTED RIVERA'S MURDER TO THE FMLN:     [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] IT IS CLEAR THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT WANT PEACE BUT INSTEAD WANTS TO CONTINUE THE VIOLENCE.  THE FMLN COMMITTED THIS CRIME.  I BELIEVE THAT A TREACHEROUS CRIME SUCH AS THIS ONE CANNOT BE CALLED ANYTHING BUT A COWARDLY ACT.  WE WILL, OF COURSE, INVESTIGATE THE CRIME.  I REPEAT, HOWEVER, THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE GATHERED ON THE FMLN'S PLANS INDICATE THAT IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION.     [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PREPARE THE COMMISSION THAT IS TO HOLD TALKS [WORDS INDISTINCT]?     [CRISTIANI] THE TERRORISTS WILL NOT OF COURSE BE SUCCESSFUL WITH ACTIONS OF THIS KIND AND WILL NOT PROVOKE US INTO VIOLENT ACTION. THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND BY NOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS SEARCHING FOR PEACE AND WANTS TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITHIN EL SALVADOR'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND BY APPLYING THE LAW.  THE FMLN REBELS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR TERRORIST ACTIONS WILL NOT LEAD US TO TAKE RASH ACTIONS; IT IS USELESS FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO ACT IN THIS WAY.     WE ARE CONTINUING OUR WORK ON SETTING UP THE COMMISSION.  TODAY WE WILL SPEAK WITH TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE STILL NOT TOLD US IF THEY WILL ACCEPT MY INVITATION TO BE COMMISSION MEMBERS.  THE NAMES OF THE COMMISSION MEMBERS WILL BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC ONCE THE COMMISSION IS FULLY FORMED.     [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S ROLE IN THIS COMMISSION?     [CRISTIANI] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED IN THIS COMMISSION BECAUSE IT IS A POLITICAL COMMISSION AND NOT ONE IN WHICH THE CHURCH CAN EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPATE.  THE CHURCH HAS ALWAYS WORKED FOR PEACE AND HAS MADE ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS TO FIND PEACE FOR THE COUNTRY THE CHURCH WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD THIS GOAL.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT THE CHURCH HAS A DIFFERENT ROLE TO PLAY IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE, AND THAT ROLE IS NOT SERVING ON THE POLITICAL COMMISSION.     [REPORTER] WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN THE MONTH THAT YOU HAVE SERVED AS PRESIDENT?     [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE THAT THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE HAS BEEN OUR INABILITY TO LAUNCH OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM, WHICH IS DUE TO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS EXISTING IN THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE TOOK OVER. WE HAVE REPEATEDLY OBSERVED THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE MAJORITY OF GOVERNMENT [WORD INDISTINCT].  THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT OFFICES, DISORDER WAS RAMPANT, AND, IN MANY CASES, WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICES WERE MANAGED IRRESPONSIBLY.  MOREOVER, THE NATION'S PUBLIC FINANCES HAVE GREATLY DETERIORATED.  WE HAVE INHERITED A COUNTRY IN VERY BAD FINANCIAL SHAPE, AND, I BELIEVE, THIS HAS DELAYED THE LAUNCHING OF OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. [END RECORDING]     CRISTIANI, REFERRING TO COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS' OFFER TO HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS IN COSTA RICAN TERRITORY, SAID THAT THE OFFER WAS A GREAT CONTRIBUTION TOWARD CONVINCING THE FMLN TO STOP MURDERING DEFENSELESS CITIZENS.",

ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL SPOKESMEN, THE TASK IS MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE BODIES WERE SCATTERED OVER A RADIUS OF 8 KM.  THE PLANE DEPARTED BOGOTA TOWARD CALI, AT 1213 GMT, BUT TWO POWERFUL EXPLOSION BROUGHT IT DOWN AFTER ONLY 5 MINUTES IN THE AIR.  BOMB-SQUAD EXPERTS, IN COORDINATION WITH THREE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS, HAVE STARTED TO EXAMINE THE SITE TO INVESTIGATE THE ACCIDENT AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE TRAGEDY WAS CAUSED BY A MECHANICAL FAILURE, OR IF IT WAS A TERRORIST ACTION.  THE BOGOTA CARACOL NETWORK RECEIVED AN ANONYMOUS CALL FROM THE EXTRADITABLES -- COLOMBIAN DRUG KINGPINS WANTED BY SEVERAL U.S. FEDERAL COURTS -- WHO SAID THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTION. ANOTHER NETWORK REPORTS THAT THE MAN WHO CALLED THE CARACOL NETWORK NEWS OFFICE SAID HE BELONGED TO THE EXTRADITABLES AND THAT THE ACTION WAS CARRIED OUT BECAUSE THERE WERE FIVE INFORMERS ON THE PLANE.  THE POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY ARE INVESTIGATING THE EXPLOSIONS THAT CAUSED THE PLANE TO CRASH SHORTLY AFTER IT LEFT THE BOGOTA EL DORADO AIRPORT TO GO TO CALI.",
