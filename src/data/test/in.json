SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTER LUIS YANEZ [AS HEARD] REPORTED TODAY THAT SPAIN HAS SUSPENDED AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT UNTIL THE KILLINGS OF THE SPANISH JESUITS, WHO HAD BEEN LIVING IN OUR COUNTRY FOR YEARS, ARE RESOLVED.     THIS REPORT REPRESENTS A SERIOUS POLITICAL SETBACK FOR THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.  THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S DECISION FURTHER ISOLATES THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WHICH IS ALREADY UNDER PRESSURE BECAUSE OF CALLS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SUSPENSION OF MILITARY AID.  THIS SUSPENSION REPRESENTS A HALT IN THE DELIVERY OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT TO SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.     THIS REPRESENTS INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION.  THE INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION OF THE CRISTIANI REGIME IS GROWING.",

SHE HAS DESCRIBED U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CASOLO AS AN ERP [PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY ARMY] MEMBER IN CHARGE OF LOGISTICS.     AS HAS BEEN REPORTED, CASOLO WAS RELEASED BY A MILITARY JUDGE AFTER HE DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE AGAINST HER.  SOME GROUPS, HOWEVER, ASSERT THAT CASOLO WAS RELEASED DUE TO POLITICAL PRESSURE FROM THE UNITED STATES, WHICH THREATENED TO LAUNCH A WORLDWIDE CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT EL SALVADOR IF CASOLO WAS NOT RELEASED.     AGUILAR MARROQUIN WAS ARRESTED AT 1500 ON 9 DECEMBER AFTER HAVING PARTICIPATED IN AN ATTACK ON AN URBAN PUBLIC BUS NEAR JUAN PABLO II BOULEVARD.     THE WOMAN FLED AND SOUGHT REFUGE INSIDE THE FACILITIES OF THE SALVADORAN ALBERTO MASFERRER UNIVERSITY, WHERE SHE TOOK A GROUP OF STUDENTS AS HOSTAGES, THREATENING THEM WITH HAND GRENADES. THE POLICE PREVENTED HER FROM DOING ANYTHING AND ARRESTED HER, CONFISCATING ONE .45-CALIBER PISTOL, BULLETS, CARTRIDGES, AND TWO FRAGMENTATION GRENADES.     AGUILAR MARROQUIN SAID THAT SHE JOINED THE ERP LAST MARCH AND THAT SHE WAS PART OF AN URBAN COMMANDO CALLED WORKERS JUSTICE COMMAND. AGUILAR ADDED THAT SHE KNOWS U.S. CITIZEN JENNIFER CASOLO, WHO BELONGS TO THE ERP, AND THAT CASOLO USED TO MEET WITH TERRORIST LEADER FERNANDO, WORKERS JUSTICE COMMAND OPERATIONS CHIEF, NEAR THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY (UES).     AGUILAR ADDED THAT CASOLO WAS IN CHARGE OF ERP LOGISTICS, ESPECIALLY LODGING PEOPLE AND TRANSPORTING ARMS AND WAR EQUIPMENT. THE ERP HAD GIVEN HER TWO MINIBUSES FOR HER TO CARRY OUT HER TASKS.     IN ADDITION, AGUILAR SAID THAT SHE BELIEVES CASOLO HAD A LEADING POSITION WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION, BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO MEETING WITH FERNANDO, SHE ALSO MET WITH AN INDIVIDUAL KNOWN AS MINCHO, WHO IS THE POLITICAL-MILITARY ERP METROPOLITAN CHIEF AND ALSO THE CHIEF OF THE SO-CALLED URBAN COMMANDOS.     THE PRISONER KNEW ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE ARMS IN CASOLO'S HOUSE, BECAUSE ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS AGUILAR'S CHIEF, KNOWN AS MIRIAM, TOLD HER ABOUT IT. OTHER TERRORISTS WENT TO CASOLO'S HOUSE TO GET WEAPONS, AMMUNITION, AND EXPLOSIVES TO CONDUCT THEIR SABOTAGE OPERATIONS AGAINST BUSES, TELEPHONE DISTRIBUTION BOXES, POWER PYLONS, OR TO CONDUCT LARGE OPERATIONS--AS AGUILAR DESCRIBED THEM-- SUCH AS ATTACKS ON MILITARY GARRISONS.     ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION OBTAINED, THE PRISONER WILL BE SENT TO COURT OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.",

I THEREFORE WANTED TO CONVEY A MESSAGE OF HOPE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO EVERY CHILEAN, TO SHOW THEM MY FEELINGS AT THIS TIME OF DEEP REFLECTION.     FROM THE VERY MOMENT I LEARNED ABOUT THIS TERRORIST ECONOMIC AGGRESSION, I ORDERED THE CREATION OF FOUR MINISTERIAL COMMISSIONS TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM. I ALSO SENT TWO MINISTERS TO THE UNITED STATES TO MEET WITH U.S.  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. AFTER TIRING SESSIONS OF TALKS, THESE MINISTERS MANAGED TO OVERCOME A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE GRAPE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM AFFECTING OTHER FRUITS REMAINS TO BE SOLVED.     THIS NEW ATTACK AGAINST THE CHILEAN NATION, AN ATTACK THAT DESTINY HAS PLACED IN THE NATION'S PATH OF FREEDOM, PROGRESS, AND WELL-BEING, COMPELS US TO CLOSE RANKS BEHIND THE GOVERNMENT, UNIFIED AND READY TO FIGHT -- WITH COURAGE AND HIGH SPIRIT -- THE PROBLEM THAT FACES US.     ON THIS OCCASION THE COUNTRY HAS SEEN HOW THE COUNTLESS THREATS TO BOYCOTT THE NATIONAL ECONOMY HAVE WORKED. MOST OF THE TIME SUCH THREATS HAVE BEEN PROMOTED BY CERTAIN POLITICIANS, LABOR LEADERS, OR COMMUNIST LABOR UNIONS, BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO -- DRIVEN BY PERSONAL OR IDEOLOGICAL INTEREST -- HAVE CONTINUALLY JEOPARDIZED THE STABILITY OF WORKERS, OF FAMILIES, AND OF THOSE WHOM THEY DEMAGOGICALLY CALL THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN. THEY DO NOT CARE IF THEY CAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT, POVERTY, AND HUNGER TO 500,000 FELLOW CITIZENS WHO WORK IN THIS AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY.     HOW SHAMELESSLY THEY MAKE CLAIMS AND DEMANDS, OFFERING THEIR SUPPORT AND THEIR SOLIDARITY WHEN CHILE IS SERIOUSLY THREATENED! YET WHEN THE DANGER IS OVER, THEY CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE AND AGAIN LEVEL CHARGES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND CRITICIZE ITS ACTIONS. IN DOING THAT THEY FAIL TO RECALL THAT FROM ITS VERY BEGINNING THE CHILEAN NATION HAS BEEN BUILT UPON NON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ESSENCE OF THE NATIONAL SOUL.     GENTLEMEN: OUR WILL IS BASED ON OUR FEELING OF UNITY IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY, WHETHER FROM THE ACTION OF NATURE OR FROM THE ACTION OF TREACHEROUS, DISTURBED MINDS THAT RECOGNIZE NO MORAL VALUES, FATHERLAND, OR LAW.     CHILEANS: A FEW DAYS AGO I REPORTED ON THE STEPS FORWARD IN THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION PROCESS AND ON THE PROGRESS THAT OUR COUNTRY HAS MADE IN ALL FIELDS.     THE FACT THAT CYANIDE HAS BEEN INJECTED INTO TWO EXPORTED GRAPES HAS CAUSED INCALCULABLE DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY; IT HAS ALSO BROUGHT THE SHADOW OF ANGUISH AND UNCERTAINTY TO THOUSANDS OF HOMES OF FELLOW COUNTRYMEN WHOSE JOBS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO A LIVELIHOOD HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY JEOPARDIZED. IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT SOME OFFICIALS OF IMPORTING COUNTRIES, WITHOUT WEIGHING THE TRUE EFFECTS OF THIS TYPE OF MEASURE, HAVE RESTRICTED THE IMPORT OF CHILEAN FRUITS, THUS PROVOKING FEAR AND DISTRUST ON THE INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER MARKET. GENTLEMEN, WE MUST REVERSE THIS SITUATION.     WE SHOULD ONCE AGAIN ACT IN A UNITED MANNER TO RECOVER INTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE AND OUR UNDISPUTED LEADERSHIP AS EXPORTERS. I AM SURE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED WITH A NEW JOINT EFFORT. [CONTINUED]",

    "doctext": "SAN SALVADOR, 22 APR 90 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [SPEECH] [PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] DEAR RADIO AUDIENCE: FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TALK TO YOU TONIGHT ABOUT A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY.  MANY TIMES YOU HAVE HEARD US MENTION THE WORD SOLIDARITY.  WE HAVE ALWAYS USED IT AS A WORD THAT MEANS TO THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO SUFFER THE MOST, THOSE WHO HAVE LESS.  INDEED, THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WE MUST HELP, EVEN WITH OUR OWN SACRIFICE, AND MANY TIMES WITH A HUGE SACRIFICE BY ALL OF US.  IF LOVE IS THE BOND THAT UNITES FAMILY MEMBERS, SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE GREAT PILLAR, THE CEMENT THAT UNITES SALVADORAN SOCIETY, SO THAT, UNITED, WE MAY FULFILL OUR DESIRE FOR PEACE, TRANQUILITY, HAPPINESS, AND WELL-BEING.     HOWEVER, TONIGHT ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE CONSIDER SHOULD BE THE USE OF THE WORD SOLIDARITY AND WHAT THIS WORD MEANS IN MATTERS THAT ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER.  A FEW WEEKS AGO THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OIL PRICES, TO RAISE THE PRICE OF OIL BYPRODUCTS SUCH AS GASOLINE, DIESEL, AND ALL FUELS.  IN THE PAST, THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE. PERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT DID THIS TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS WOULD HAVE NOTHING BUT POSITIVE EFFECTS.  HOWEVER, LET US ANALYZE FOR A WHILE THE ISSUE OF INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF FUEL.  WHEN A GOVERNMENT HAS NO MONEY FOR SUBSIDIZING, THAT MEANS THE COST OF LIVING WILL GO UP. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT PRICES WILL RISE WHEN A GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE THAN WHAT IT HAS.  HOWEVER, LET US SEE HOW THIS ASPECT, OR RATHER THE PRINCIPLE OF SOLIDARITY, APPLIES TO THE INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES, ESPECIALLY THE PRICE OF GASOLINE.     TEN PERCENT OF ALL FAMILIES IN OUR COUNTRY OWN A VEHICLE.  IN GENERAL, THAT 10 PERCENT ARE THOSE WHO HAVE THE MOST; IN OTHER WORDS, THOSE WHO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF BUYING A CAR, A VEHICLE.  IF WE SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE, WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING IS TAKING MONEY OUT OF A GOVERNMENT THAT, FOR THE TIME BEING, DOES NOT HAVE SUCH FUNDS AVAILABLE.  IN ORDER TO GET SUCH FUNDS, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO IMPOSE NEW TAXES WHICH WOULD AFFECT ALL SALVADORANS.  THEREFORE, LET US THINK WHETHER OR NOT IT IS FAIR THAT 90 PERCENT OF ALL SALVADORAN FAMILIES, WHO OWN NO VEHICLES, MUST PAY SOME KIND OF TAX IN ORDER TO BENEFIT THE OTHER 10 PERCENT WHO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT ALLOW THEM TO BUY A VEHICLE.     WE DO NOT WANT TO APPEAR AS DEMAGOGIC OR POPULIST WITH THIS EXAMPLE.  WHAT WE WANT TO SAY IS THAT THOSE OF US WHO OWN A VEHICLE, WHO ARE PART OF THE 10 PERCENT LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SOMETHING AND THUS CAN BUY A VEHICLE, MUST BE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THAT 90 PERCENT WHO HAVE LITTLE AND MANY TIMES NOTHING.  THEY HAVE NO VEHICLES, AND THEREFORE HAVE NO REASON TO SUFFER SO THE GASOLINE WE BUY BECOMES CHEAPER. MOREOVER, TO SOME EXTENT THE CURRENT PRICE OF GASOLINE MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR THE DIESEL SUPPLIED TO URBAN AND INTERURBAN BUS COMPANIES TO BE BOUGHT AT A PRICE THAT WILL ALLOW BUS OWNERS TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT BUS FARES.  THIS IS SOLIDARITY, AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT. THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOMETHING, WHO OWN A VEHICLE, PAY SOMETHING -- THROUGH THE PRICE OF THE GASOLINE WE CONSUME -- SO THAT THOSE WHO OWN NOTHING AND MUST USE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION BUSES CAN DO SO WITH NO PRICE INCREASE.     THE SAME SHOULD BE THE CASE FOR THE COST OF LIQUID GAS AND PROPANE GAS, SO THAT THE PRICES OF FOOD COOKED WITH GAS IN THE MARKETPLACES ARE NOT INCREASED.  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOMETHING CAN SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE LITTLE OR NOTHING AT ALL.     I WOULD NOW LIKE TO TALK ABOUT AN EXAMPLE OF AN EVEN DEEPER KIND OF SOLIDARITY.  I WANT TO TALK ABOUT PEACE.  SALVADORAN BROTHERS, THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE MOTHERS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR SONS.  WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THE INNOCENT CHILDREN WHO COULD KICK A MINE AND END UP WITHOUT AN ARM OR A LEG.  WE MUST SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO, BECAUSE OF VIOLENCE, CANNOT FIND A JOB.  THAT IS WHY THIS IS THE TIME FOR ALL OF US TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO ACHIEVE PEACE.     LAST THURSDAY I TOLD YOU I FELT MORE OPTIMISTIC AFTER MEETING WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND LISTENING TO THEIR DECISION TO ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE TO WORK FOR PEACE.  THEY ARE DETERMINED TO REACH A CONSENSUS TO FULFILL THE ASPIRATIONS OF ALL SALVADORANS.  WE ARE BEGINNING TO SENSE WHAT THE NEAR FUTURE OF EL SALVADOR COULD BE.  WE ARE FEELING HAPPY AND OPTIMISTIC.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT, THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE SHOULD ALL CONTRIBUTE TO PEACE.     ANYTHING THAT MAY LEAD TO VIOLENCE, WHETHER IT IS STREET DISTURBANCES OR BOMBS, SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED, BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER CONCEIVABLE FOR MOTHERS, CHILDREN, AND FAMILIES TO CONTINUE TO SUFFER IN OUR COUNTRY.  THE TIME HAS COME TO SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY, TO SEARCH, NOT ONLY THROUGH WORDS BUT ALSO THROUGH OUR EXAMPLES AND ACTIONS, FOR THE PEACE THAT OUR COUNTRY AND SALVADORANS DESERVE.     THEREFORE, OUR SOLIDARITY SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR OUR COUNTRY'S RECONSTRUCTION.  IT SHOULD BE THE FUNDAMENTAL TOOL FOR THE PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL RECONSTRUCTION OF ALL SALVADORANS.  WE WANT ALL SALVADORANS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, TO SUPPORT THE PEACE EFFORTS, SO THAT THOSE WHO SUFFER SO VERY MUCH FROM VIOLENCE WILL NO LONGER SUFFER.     THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL STEP FORWARD FOR THE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  SALVADORAN BROTHERS, LET US SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY IN THIS CRUCIAL TIME IN OUR HISTORY, BECAUSE WE HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT WHEN ALL SALVADORANS ACT POSITIVELY LIKE BROTHERS, WE CAN COME OUT AHEAD.  THIS IS ALL FOR TONIGHT.  THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU.",

THE BLAST FROM THE EXPLOSION HIT A TRUCK FULL OF POLICEMEN, WHO HAD EARLIER CARRIED OUT AN ANTI-MAFIA OPERATION IN A PEASANT VILLAGE, AS WELL AS SEVERAL PUBLIC BUSES, HOUSES, AND BUSINESSES.     A POLICE EXPERT SAID THAT THE CAR BOMB (CONTAINING 300 KG OF DYNAMITE) WAS ACTIVATED BY REMOTE CONTROL AS THE ELITE FORCE PATROL PASSED BY.     ACCORDING TO GOMEZ MARTINEZ, \"THESE ACTIONS WILL ONLY CEASE WHEN (PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS') GOVERNMENT PUTS ASIDE SO MUCH PREJUDICE AND AGREES TO THE PEACE TALKS,\" PROPOSED BY THE SUBVERSIVES.     \"THE DIALOGUE WILL TAKE PLACE SONNER OR LATER, AND IT IS BETTER TO START NOW,\" INSISTED THE MAYOR OF MEDELLIN, A CITY WHERE THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL CARTEL HAS ITS BASE OF OPERATIONS.     THE CHIEF OF THE CRIMINAL GANG, PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA, ORDERED THE ASSASSINATION OF MEDELLIN POLICEMEN IN RETALIATION FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTION AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS.  TWENTY-EIGHT POLICEMEN HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THIS CITY OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS.     ACCORDING TO SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS, YESTERDAY'S ATTACK \"COULD BE ESCOBAR GAVIRIA'S RESPONSE TO THE ARREST OF ADOLFO MESA MENESES,\" HIS RIGHT-HAND MAN.     MESA MENESES WAS ARRESTED LAST WEEK BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS, SECRET POLICE), AND THE AUTHORITIES HAVE ACCUSED HIM OF ASSASSINATING -- ON ORDERS FROM THE MAFIA LEADER -- LEFTIST PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, AS WELL AS A CHIEF OF POLICE, A MAYOR, AND SEVERAL JOURNALISTS.     MEANWHILE, HUNDREDS OF SOLDIERS, POLICEMEN, AND DETECTIVES ARE CARRYING OUT LARGE-SCALE OPERATIONS IN THE COLOMBIAN COUNTRYSIDE AND BORDER AREAS ON THE SUSPICION THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA PLANS TO FLEE THE COUNTRY.     LAST NIGHT, A TELEVISION NEWSCAST SHOWED PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE \"DRUG LORD\" THAT HAD BEEN \"RECENTLY\" TAKEN BY SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS AT A COLOMBIAN BEACH ON THE PACIFIC COAST.     A POLICE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN CONFIRMED TODAY THAT \"WE HAVE RELIABLE INFORMATION ON HIS WHEREABOUTS,\" ALTHOUGH HE REFRAINED FROM GIVING FURTHER DETAILS.  UNOFFICIAL SOURCES SAID THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA \"IS SOMEWHERE IN WESTERN ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT\" -- OF WHICH MEDELLIN IS THE CAPITAL -- WHERE THE SEARCH OPERATIONS ARE CONCENTRATED.     COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO ASKED FOR THE COOPERATION OF BRAZIL, ECUADOR, PANAMA, PERU, AND VENEZUELA TO STOP THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS FROM ESCAPING TO THOSE COUNTRIES.",

WE ISSUE AN APPEAL TO THE DECEIVED ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] RANK AND FILE, WHO VOTED BELIEVING THAT THIS GOVERNMENT WOULD REPRESENT A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.  WE ALSO ISSUE AN APPEAL TO ALL THE PATRIOTIC CITIZENS OF THE HOMELAND, URGING THEM TO STOP THE DESTRUCTION OF THE CAPITAL, TO STOP THE DESTRUCTION OF THE COUNTRY. WE URGE THEM TO UNITE AND STOP THE WAR; AND THE END OF THE WAR IS NEAR -- WITH THE PEOPLE'S VICTORY.  [CONTINUED]",

CAMBARALAMAIA'S ORGANIZATION IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY GANGS IN THE REGION THAT DEALS WITH BOLIVIAN COCAINE.  ANOTHER GANG IS LED BY GERSON PALERMO, OF UMUARAMA, PARANA STATE, WHO CONTROLS THE EXCHANGE OF COCAINE TO PARAGUAY FOR STOLEN BRAZILIAN CARS.  PALERMO OWNS FOUR TWIN-ENGINED CESSNA PLANES AND EMPLOYS MORE THAN 200 MEN.  HE ALSO EXCHANGE CARS FOR COCAINE IN BOLIVIA.  ALTHOUGH SENTENCED BY THE BRAZILIAN COURTS, PALERMO LIVES IN PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO, PARAGUAY, WHERE HE MAINTAINS BUSINESS CONTACTS WITH THE BOLIVIAN COCA PRODUCERS. PALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR REFINING THE DRUG, FROM ARGENTINA.     THE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVES THAT THE DRUG MIGHT BE REFINED IN MATO GROSSO DO SUL, NEAR SOME RESIDENCES IN THE DOURADOS AND CAMPO GRANDE SECTORS.  PALERMO EXCHANGES THE CHEMICALS FOR TONS OF COCAINE PASTE WHICH, IN THE OPINION OF REGIONAL FEDERAL POLICE DELEGATE FRANCISCO VIANA QUEIROZ, IS ALSO PROCESSED IN PARAGUAY.  VIANA QUEIROZ MAINTAINS THAT THE DRUG IS REFINED BY A GROUP OF TRAFFICKERS LED BY ARSENIO BENITEZ GONZALEZ, WHO IS KNOWN AS VILHAR AND WHO LIVES IN ASUNCION. THE FEDERAL POLICE BELIEVE THAT VILHAR -- WHO IS BELIEVED TO BE PALERMO'S PARTNER -- IS THE BRAZILIAN TRAFFICKERS' MAIN COCAINE SUPPLIER.     ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, TWO DRUG ROUTES PASS THROUGH MATO GROSSO DO SUL: THE PONTA PORA ROUTE (WHICH IS USED BY PALERMO), AND THE CORUMBA ROUTE, WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE BOLIVIAN TOWN OF PUERTO SUAREZ.  MANY TRAFFICKERS COME TO THIS BOLIVIAN TOWN, MOST OF THEM SMALL SUPPLIERS WHO ONLY WANT TO EXCHANGE COCAINE FOR CARS THAT WERE STOLEN IN BRAZIL.  ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORITIES, THE CORUMBA ROUTE IS MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT CHANNELS THE SO-CALLED \"MINI-TRAFFIC.\"  THIS INVOLVES HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO, TOGETHER, MAKE UP A SIZABLE QUANTITY OF DRUGS EVERY DAY.     THE CARS ARE THE HARD CURRENCY USED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS.  MOST OF THEM ARE TAKEN TO BOLIVIA AFTER HAVING BEEN STOLEN IN SAO PAULO.  THEY FOLLOW THE SAME ROUTE AS THE BOLIVIAN COCAINE, THAT IS, VIA PUERTO SUAREZ.  THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE TRAFFICKING, HOWEVER, IS CARRIED OUT IN PARAGUAY AND BOLIVIA.  GERSON PALERMO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PART OF IT, WHILE THE REST IS SHARED BY HUNDREDS OF BOLIVIAN TRAFFICKERS.  PALERMO OBTAINS ETHER AND ACETONE FROM FORMOSA, ARGENTINA.  HE TAKES THESE CHEMICALS ABOARD SMALL PLANES TO THE TOWNS OF PILAR OR ENCARNACION, IN PARAGUAY. FROM THERE, ANOTHER GROUP TAKES THE 200-LITER DRUMS ALONG THE CHACO HIGHWAY TO PUERTO GUARANI, IN BOLIVIA.  BOLIVIAN TRAFFICKERS TAKE CARE OF THE REST OF THE JOURNEY TO SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA.  IN RETURN, PALERMO RECEIVES COCAINE PASTE WHICH IS SHIPPED TO ASUNCION AND, FROM THERE, TO PEDRO JUAN CABALLERO FOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE PROCESSING UNITS.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE TRAFFICKERS USE SOME RANCHES NEAR PORTO MURTINHO (MATO GROSSO DE SUL), NEAR THE PARAGUAYAN TOWN OF BAHIA NEGRA, TO PROCESS LARGE QUANTITIES OF COCAINE.     NO COCAINE PASTE IS USUALLY AVAILABLE ALONG THE CORUMBA ROUTE.  THE DRUG IS REFINED BECAUSE IT IS RELATIVELY EASY TO FIND ETHER AND ACETONE IN CORUMBA, WHERE THE FEDERAL POLICE HAVE FAILED TO REDUCE THE LARGE DEMAND FOR SUCH CHEMICALS IN RETAIL STORES.  DOZENS OF DRUGSTORES SELL THOSE PRODUCTS BY THE LITER, AND THIS IS NOT FORBIDDEN BY LAW.     THE AUTHORITIES ESTIMATE THAT PRODUCTION IN THE PUERTO SUAREZ REGION NEARS 300 KG PER WEEK, WHICH IS TRANSPORTED BY RAILROAD, AIR, AND LAND.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO EVADE THE FEDERAL POLICE, TRAFFICKERS HAVE TRIED TO TRANSPORT THE DRUG INSIDE THEIR BODIES, IN WINE DEMIJOHNS, AND EVEN IN CHILDREN'S DIAPERS.  THESE TRAFFICKERS GENERALLY TRAVEL BY BUS OR BY TRAIN. OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS THE POLICE CAUGHT DOZENS OF TRAFFICKERS USING THESE METHODS.  NOW, HOWEVER, ONLY WITH THE COMPLICITY OF THE POLICE CAN CARS CARRYING BOLIVIAN COCAINE PRODUCED IN THE PUERTO SUAREZ REGION REACH CAMPO GRANDE.",

[GARCIA] AS PRESIDENT OF ALL PERUVIANS -- AND OF VARGAS LLOSA TO EVEN IF HE DOES NOT LIKE IT -- I CANNOT PASS JUDGMENT, EITHER ETHICALLY OR INTELLECTUALLY, ON A POLITICIAN AND PERUVIAN WHO IS CONTENDING FOR THE PRESIDENCY.

[GARCIA, INTERRUPTING] SURE, I ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION, AND I HOPE SOME COLOMBIANS WILL EXTEND IT.  HOWEVER, I WANT TO TELL YOU VERY HONESTLY, THAT I AM PERHAPS BETTER AT SELLING DREAMS, IDEAS, AND DOCTRINES THAN AT ADMINISTERING A SITUATION OF PENURY, LIKE THE ONE OUR COUNTRIES ARE EXPERIENCING, AND MOST PARTICULARLY PERU, WHICH IS ONE OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA.  IT IS VERY DIFFICULT. FOR INSTANCE, ON A DAY WHEN THE PRICE OF RICE OR CHICKEN GOES UP, THE PEOPLE WILL NOT BELIEVE YOU, EVEN IF YOU TELL THEM THE GREATEST OF TRUTHS.  ONE CAN BE PREACHING SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT, BUT IF IT FAILED TO RAIN AND THE CITY HAD NO WATER NO ONE WILL BELIEVE OF YOU THE GREATEST OF ALL TRUTHS.  THEN, WHEN ONE STOPS BEING PRESIDENT AND ADMINISTERING PENURY, ONE CAN DEVOTE ONESELF TO CONVINCING PEOPLE, TO EDUCATING.  THAT IS WHAT I SHOULD DO.     [AMAT] NOW, WHY DID YOU MAKE THAT ASIDE, MAKING ME PRESIDENT OF ALL PERUVIANS, EVEN OF VARGAS LLOSA?  WHETHER HE LIKES OR NOT IT HURTS HIM.

[GARCIA] VERY WELL.  COLOMBIANS, WHO HAVE SEEN THEIR INSTITUTION THREATENED, THEIR PRESS ABUSED, AND MANY POLITICIANS ALSO THREATENED, MUST HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT LATIN AMERICA, TOGETHER WITH THE UNITED STATES, WILL CONFRONT THE PROBLEM OF DRUG TRAFFICKING.  THIS IS NOT ONLY A PROBLEM FOR COLOMBIA.  IT IS OUR PROBLEM TOO, AND WE WILL TACKLE IT.

THE NEWSPAPER STATED THAT THE ALLEGED RIFT BETWEEN THE MILITARY OFFICERS BEGAN ONCE IT WAS DISCOVERED WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS, IN WHICH ONE COLONEL, TWO LIEUTENANTS, AND SIX SOLDIERS ARE BEING CHARGED.     COLONEL PONCE SAID THAT THE RELATIONS WITH U.S. ADVISERS -- ABOUT 52 IN THE COUNTRY -- ARE VERY CORDIAL.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] OUR RELATIONS WITH THE NORTH AMERICANS ARE NORMAL AS USUAL.  THE U.S. ADVISERS HAVE HELPED US VERY MUCH IN THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND THEY CONTINUE WORKING WITH US.     [REPORTER] WHERE DO YOU THINK THESE WIRE REPORTS STATING THERE ARE RIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN MILITARY OFFICERS AND U.S.  ADVISERS HAVE ORGINIATED?     [PONCE] I DO NOT KNOW; I CANNOT UNDERSTAND.

THIS IS A POOR COUNTRY THAT DEPENDS A GREAT DEAL ON U.S. ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID.     [REPORTER] FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF THE JESUITS, WHAT ARE RELATIONS LIKE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN MILITARY AND THE GRINGO ADVISERS?     [PONCE] AS USUAL, THESE RELATIONS ARE VERY CORDIAL, AND THEY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US.  AS YOU CAN SEE, TWO ADVISERS ARE HERE WITH ME NOW AT THE TABLE PRESIDING OVER THE EVENT.  THE SAME HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH ALL THE UNITS IN THE COUNTRY'S INTERIOR.  I FAIL TO SEE ANY DIFFERENCE IN RELATIONS BEFORE AND AFTERWARD. [END RECORDING]     THE MILITARY CHIEF REPEATED THE NEED TO MAINTAIN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, NOT ONLY DUE TO THE GUERRILLA ATTACKS, BUT ALSO TO KEEP CONTROL OVER THE ORGANIZATION FRONTS JUST PRIOR TO AN EXPECTED WAVE OF PROTESTS ON THE LATEST GOVERNMENT ECONOMY MEASURES.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [PONCE] WE MUST START THINKING WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO DOMESTIC ORDER IN THE FACE OF THE ECONOMIC MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED OR ARE PLANNED.  WE MUST THINK WHAT THE REACTION OF THE PEOPLE OR THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] ORGANIZATION FRONTS WILL BE, AS THEY ALWAYS USE ANY EXCUSE TO DISRUPT DOMESTIC ORDER.  IT WOULD BE GOOD TO LOOK INTO WHAT IS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN DOMESTIC ORDER IN THE COUNTRY. [END RECORDING]     THE HIGH-RANKING MILITARY OFFICER GAVE THESE STATEMENTS AT THE CEREMONY TO TURN OVER COMMAND OF THE CAPTAIN GENERAL GERARDO BARRIOS MILITARY ACADEMY.  THE NEW COMMANDER IS COLONEL RICARDO ALFONSO CASANOVA SANDOVAL, WHO REPLACES COLONEL GUILLERMO ALFREDO BENAVIDES MORENO, REMOVED FROM HIS POST AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF ORDERING THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.     MEANWHILE, COLONEL HECTOR HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ HAS BEEN APPOINTED COMMANDER OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE BASED IN USULUTAN, AND IN LA UNION DEPARTMENT THE CHANGE OF COMMAND CEREMONIES OF THE ARMED FORCES MILITARY TRAINING CENTER HAVE TAKEN PLACE, WHERE COLONEL FRANCISCO ARTURO LOPEZ WILL BE IN COMMAND REPLACING COLONEL CARLOS ALFREDO RIVAS, WHO HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF.",

PRESIDENT, THE NEWSPAPER LA JORNADA OF MEXICO STATED YESTERDAY THAT COLONEL ORLANDO ZEPEDA HAD LEFT THE COUNTRY THIS WEEKEND WITH ALL HIS FAMILY AND WITH A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF LUGGAGE, WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT HE DID NOT GO ON A MERE VACATION.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE OFFICIAL VERSION OF THIS. [LAUGHTER]     [CRISTIANI] YOU SAY HE LEFT WHEN?     [REPORTER] YESTERDAY.     [CRISTIANI] WELL, ONLY IF HE LEFT VERY HURRIEDLY AFTER MIDDAY.  I WAS WITH HIM HERE YESTERDAY DISCUSSING OTHER THINGS, AS WELL AS MILITARY MATTERS WITH THE DEFENSE MINISTER AND DEPUTY MINISTERS.  HE WAS PRESENT.  UNLESS HE MAY HAVE LEFT.  I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH, BECAUSE I HAD A MEETING WITH THEM TO SEE THE ORDER OF THE MONTH ON SATURDAY AND HE WAS PRESENT.  PARDON ME, THAT WAS TUESDAY WHEN WE HAD THE ORDER FOR THE END OF THE MONTH.  I UNDERSTAND HE WAS PRESENT AT THE COMMANDERS MEETING.  IF HE LEFT LAST WEEKEND, IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR THE WEEKEND AND HE RETURNED ON MONDAY.     [MODERATOR] MARIA CORTINA, NOTIMEX.     [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, IN WHAT WAY WOULD A CUT IN MILITARY AID AFFECT THE PEACE PROCESS?     [CRISTIANI] WE ARE CURRENTLY SEEING OPPOSITE SIGNS FROM THE FMLN IN TERMS OF WANTING TO TRULY PUT AN END TO VIOLENCE.  A SIGN OF THIS WAS THE NIGHT OF 1 MAY WHEN THE ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT.  THIS WOULD INDICATE THAT, ALTHOUGH NOT ALL THE FMLN COMMAND, THAT IS THE FIVE GROUPS, SOME GROUPS SEEM TO RESIST A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND FAVOR A MILITARY SOLUTION, AS THEY HAVE INSISTED ON PURSUING FOR 10 YEARS. THOSE GROUPS COULD VIEW A CUT IN MILITARY AID AS A SIGN OF WEAKENING OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES, AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY THEY WOULD HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF BEING SUCCESSFUL FOLLOWING THE MILITARY PATH.  THAT COULD INCREASE THE POTENTIAL OF A MILITARY SOLUTION IN THE MINDS OF SOME.  THIS COULD REDUCE THE POTENTIAL OF SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.     [MODERATOR] RAUL MONGE, CADENA RADIO CENTRO.     [REPORTER] MR. PRESIDENT, HOW DO YOU VIEW THE GUERRILLAS' MORALE AT THIS MOMENT?     [CRISTIANI] WELL, I OBVIOUSLY CANNOT BUT BELIEVE THAT THE MORALE OF THE GUERRILLAS AFTER THE OFFENSIVE MUST HAVE DROPPED CONSIDERBLY. THIS IS ESPECIALLY SO SINCE THERE WAS A LARGE SACRIFICE ON THEIR PART IN THE FORM OF CASUALTIES AND THE FACT THAT THE OFFENSIVE DID NOT REPRESENT A SUCCESS, DESPITE THEIR CLAIM THAT IT WAS ONLY A SHOW OF FORCE, WHICH IS A LOT OF MALARKEY.  ALL THE PRIOR DOCUMENTS INDICATED THAT THIS WAS A LARGE-SCALE OPERATION TO THE HILT SEEKING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT AND TO CROWN A MILITARY VICTORY.  WHAT I BELIEVE WAS OF EVEN GREATER IMPACT WAS THAT THEY REALIZED THAT THE PEOPLE OF EL SALVADOR DO NOT SUPPORT THEM AND DO NOT SUPPORT THE PATH OF VIOLENCE. IN THAT SENSE, THEIR HOPES OF A POPULAR INSURRECTION WERE SHATTERED. ON THE CONTRARY, THE PEOPLE DID NOT SUPPORT THE FMLN AND INSTEAD TURNED THEIR BACKS ON THEM AND SHOWED THAT THEY DO NOT SUPPORT VIOLENCE.  THIS MUST HAVE CAUSED AN IMPACT ON THE FMLN AND ITS MEMBERS.  I RECENTLY READ IN A VENEZUELAN NEWSPAPER STATEMENTS BY A COMMANDER, WHOSE PSEUDONYM IS GUSTAVO, WHO SAID THAT THEY WERE TIRED OF FOLLOWING THE PATH OF VIOLENCE AND THAT A SOLUTION HAD TO BE FOUND. THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT SOME OF THEIR RANKS ARE GETTING TIRED OF THE MILITARY PATH.  THESE ARE INDICATIONS OF WHAT COULD BE.  WHAT I WANT TO CLEAR UP ONCE AND FOR ALL IS THAT WE DO NOT REACT TO WHETHER OR NOT THE FMLN FEELS STRONG OR FEELS WEAK.  WE KNOW THAT 100 TERRORISTS IN A COUNTRY CAN CAUSE DESTRUCTION AND DEATH AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO AVOID, ALTHOUGH 100 TERRORISTS ARE NOT A FORCE THAT WILL DESTABILIZE A GOVERNMENT.  HOWEVER, THE DAMAGE THAT THEY CAUSE IS SUCH THAT WE DO NOT WANT IT TO CONTINUE.  [CONTINUED]",

THE REPORT SAYS THAT SAN SALVADOR NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS ARE STILL UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN].  ARMED FORCES OFFICIAL SOURCES HAVE ADMITTED THAT SOME AREAS OF SAN SALVADOR ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FMLN.  THE REPORT ADDS THAT AS OF 2140 ON 12 NOVEMBER, THERE WAS STILL TENSION IN THE CITY.     SOME SPORADIC SHOOTING WAS STILL HEARD, AND THE SITUATION IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CAPITAL CITY INDICATED THAT OUR COMRADES ARE MAINTAINING THEIR POSITIONS, THEY ARE CARRYING OUT MILITARY ENGINEERING TASKS, OPENING TRENCHES, AND SETTING UP BARRICADES WITH THE COOPERATION OF THE SAN SALVADOR PEOPLE.     PRESS AGENCY REPORTS NOTE THAT THERE IS GREAT TENSION IN THE CAPITAL CITY, AND APPARENTLY THEY ARE EXPECTING [CHANGES THOUGHT] HERE IS A NEWS AGENCY REPORT WHICH SAYS THAT EARLY THIS MORNING, LESS SHOOTING WAS HEARD BECAUSE APPARENTLY EACH SIDE HAD CONSOLIDATED THEIR POSITION.  THAT IS WHAT SOME PRESS AGENCIES ARE REPORTING.     WE HAVE ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ADMITTED THAT SOME AREAS IN THE CAPITAL CITY ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FMLN.  THERE ARE MANY VEHICLES SCATTERED ALL OVER THE STREETS OF SAN SALVADOR.  THAT IS THE REPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM SAN SALVADOR, WHERE OUR FIGHTERS IN ZACAMIL AND OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN THE CAPITAL CITY ARE NOW RECEIVING THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FORTIFYING THEMSELVES IN NEIGHBORHOODS.     WE CALL ON THE SAN SALVADORAN YOUTHS TO GO OUT TONIGHT TO COOPERATE WITH THE FMLN FIGHTERS.  MAKE THE ASSASSINS OF MSGR ROMERO PAY DEARLY FOR EVERY STEP THEY TAKE AGAINST THE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN SALVADOR CITY.  IT HAS BEEN 24, 25, NEARLY 26 HOURS SINCE THE FMLN FIGHTERS ESTABLISHED THEIR POSITIONS IN SAN SALVADOR IN VIEW OF THE REGIME'S INCOMPETENCE.  THE REGIME HAS CLEARLY SAID THAT IT IS INCAPABLE OF CONTROLLING THE SITUATION, AS IT HAS HAD TO DECREE A STATE OF SIEGE THAT BEGAN ON THE EVENING OF 12 NOVEMBER IN SAN SALVADOR.     ANOTHER EVIDENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S WEAKNESS IS THE GAG PLACED ON THE MEDIA.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ALLOWED THE MEDIA TO BROADCAST ITS NEWSCASTS.  WHY DOESN'T THE GOVERNMENT WANT THE PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO NEWSCASTS IN EL SALVADOR?  WHAT IS THE CRISTIANI REGIME HIDING?  THIS IS A QUESTION THAT THE PEOPLE ARE ASKING; THEY WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWER.  THE GOVERNMENT IS AFRAID, IT DOES NOT WANT TO INFORM THE PEOPLE ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTS OR THE SCOPE OF THE ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN THROUGHOUT THE NATIONAL TERRITORY.     COMRADE FIGHTERS: WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU; THIS IS IN THE BAG. YOUR COURAGE AND DETERMINATION TO WIN HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT THE FMLN PLAN AS OUR COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE GENERAL COMMAND HAS SAID.     COMRADES: KEEP IT UP, KEEP AN OPEN EYE, KEEP UP THE HIGH MORALE AS YOU HAVE DONE UP TO NOW, SEEK CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE, RECEIVE THEIR COOPERATION IN THE FORTIFICATIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE THROUGHOUT SAN SALVADOR.

HE SAID THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION IS CONTINUING ITS EFFORTS TO FORM A COMMISSION FOR A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS AND THAT HE IS NOW AWAITING WORD FROM TWO PEOPLE WHOM HE HAS CHOSEN TO SERVE ON THE COMMISSION. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED ON THE COMMISSION BECAUSE THE COMMISSION IS COMPLETELY POLITICAL IN NATURE.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF NATIONAL FIRE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR COLONEL ROBERTO ARMANDO RIVERA ESCOBAR, WHO WAS KILLED IN A MACHINEGUN ATTACK THIS MORNING.  PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ATTRIBUTED RIVERA'S MURDER TO THE FMLN:     [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] IT IS CLEAR THAT THE FMLN DOES NOT WANT PEACE BUT INSTEAD WANTS TO CONTINUE THE VIOLENCE.  THE FMLN COMMITTED THIS CRIME.  I BELIEVE THAT A TREACHEROUS CRIME SUCH AS THIS ONE CANNOT BE CALLED ANYTHING BUT A COWARDLY ACT.  WE WILL, OF COURSE, INVESTIGATE THE CRIME.  I REPEAT, HOWEVER, THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE GATHERED ON THE FMLN'S PLANS INDICATE THAT IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION.     [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO PREPARE THE COMMISSION THAT IS TO HOLD TALKS [WORDS INDISTINCT]?     [CRISTIANI] THE TERRORISTS WILL NOT OF COURSE BE SUCCESSFUL WITH ACTIONS OF THIS KIND AND WILL NOT PROVOKE US INTO VIOLENT ACTION. THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND BY NOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS SEARCHING FOR PEACE AND WANTS TO ACHIEVE PEACE WITHIN EL SALVADOR'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND BY APPLYING THE LAW.  THE FMLN REBELS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR TERRORIST ACTIONS WILL NOT LEAD US TO TAKE RASH ACTIONS; IT IS USELESS FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO ACT IN THIS WAY.     WE ARE CONTINUING OUR WORK ON SETTING UP THE COMMISSION.  TODAY WE WILL SPEAK WITH TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE STILL NOT TOLD US IF THEY WILL ACCEPT MY INVITATION TO BE COMMISSION MEMBERS.  THE NAMES OF THE COMMISSION MEMBERS WILL BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC ONCE THE COMMISSION IS FULLY FORMED.     [REPORTER] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S ROLE IN THIS COMMISSION?     [CRISTIANI] [WORDS INDISTINCT] THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED IN THIS COMMISSION BECAUSE IT IS A POLITICAL COMMISSION AND NOT ONE IN WHICH THE CHURCH CAN EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPATE.  THE CHURCH HAS ALWAYS WORKED FOR PEACE AND HAS MADE ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS TO FIND PEACE FOR THE COUNTRY THE CHURCH WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD THIS GOAL.  HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT THE CHURCH HAS A DIFFERENT ROLE TO PLAY IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE, AND THAT ROLE IS NOT SERVING ON THE POLITICAL COMMISSION.     [REPORTER] WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN THE MONTH THAT YOU HAVE SERVED AS PRESIDENT?     [CRISTIANI] I BELIEVE THAT THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE HAS BEEN OUR INABILITY TO LAUNCH OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM, WHICH IS DUE TO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS EXISTING IN THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE TOOK OVER. WE HAVE REPEATEDLY OBSERVED THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE MAJORITY OF GOVERNMENT [WORD INDISTINCT].  THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT OFFICES, DISORDER WAS RAMPANT, AND, IN MANY CASES, WE HAVE OBSERVED THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICES WERE MANAGED IRRESPONSIBLY.  MOREOVER, THE NATION'S PUBLIC FINANCES HAVE GREATLY DETERIORATED.  WE HAVE INHERITED A COUNTRY IN VERY BAD FINANCIAL SHAPE, AND, I BELIEVE, THIS HAS DELAYED THE LAUNCHING OF OUR GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. [END RECORDING]     CRISTIANI, REFERRING TO COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS' OFFER TO HOLD A DIALOGUE WITH THE REBELS IN COSTA RICAN TERRITORY, SAID THAT THE OFFER WAS A GREAT CONTRIBUTION TOWARD CONVINCING THE FMLN TO STOP MURDERING DEFENSELESS CITIZENS.",

FOR LIBERAL CESAR GAVIRIA TRUJILLO, \"NONVIOLENT SOLUTIONS\" MUST BE FOUND THROUGH A CONDITIONED DIALOGUE WITH THE GUERRILLAS AND BY STRENGTHENING JUSTICE TO CONFRONT THE NARCOTRAFFICKERS \"BECAUSE EXTRADITION CANNOT BE THE ONLY PATH TO FIGHT THIS CRIME.\"     GAVIRIA, 43, WHO ACCORDING TO THE POLLS IS THE FAVORITE TO SUCCEED VIRGILIO BARCO AS PRESIDENT AFTER THE 27 MAY ELECTIONS, HAS MADE THE PROBLEMS OF THE GUERRILLAS AND DRUG MAFIAS THE TWO MAIN ISSUES IN HIS GOVERNMENT PLATFORM.     REGARDING THE ARMED REBELS, HE INSISTS THAT NONVIOLENT SOLUTIONS MUST BE FOUND AND PROMISES TO \"TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION\" THE MERITS OF WHAT HAS BEEN TESTED UP TO NOW.     \"THE DIALOGUE WITH THE ARMED REBELS IS A CONCESSION THAT HAS BEEN MADE TO THEM, AND FOR THIS REASON SOCIETY HAS EVERY RIGHT TO ESTABLISH CONDITIONS,\" GAVIRIA STATED.  \"THUS,\" HE ADDED, \"THE DIALOGUE WILL PREVENT THE GUERRILLAS FROM HAVING A POLITICAL PROTAGONIST ROLE AND WILL AVERT THE JUSTIFICATION OF VIOLENCE.\"     SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE RODRIGO LLOREDA CAICEDO, 47, INSISTS THAT \"THE SURRENDER OF THE MAFIA LORDS MUST BE ACHIEVED\" AND THAT THIS \"SHOULD INCLUDE PENALTIES FOR THE CRIMES COMMITTED, ECONOMIC COMPENSATION, AND THE CERTAINTY THAT COLOMBIA WILL NOT CONTINUE TO LEND ITSELF TO PRODUCE AND EXPORT DRUGS.\"     LLOREDA CAICEDO IS OPPOSED TO THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO THE UNITED STATES, AND HE OFFERS TO \"STRENGTHEN JUSTICE\" AND TO CHANGE PROCEDURES SO AS TO SURROUND JUDGES WITH GUARANTEES, ALL WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM THROUGH A PLEBISCITE TO CONVOKE A NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.     FOR THE ARMED REBELS, HE OFFERS \"A 12-MONTH TERM FOR THEM TO REJOIN CIVILIAN LIFE\" AND THE DRAFTING OF \"MECHANISMS\" FOR THEIR DISBANDING, SUCH AS THE \"NATIONAL CIRCUMSCRIPTION\" THAT WILL FACILITATE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRATIC AND POLITICAL LIFE.     LLOREDA CAICEDO, FOREIGN MINISTER DURING BELISARIO BETANCUR'S ADMINISTRATION AND ONE OF THE PROPONENTS OF THE CONTADORA GROUP TO ATTAIN PEACE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, SAID THAT AN EFFORT MUST BE MADE TO \"RECOVER THE MONOPOLY OF THE PUBLIC FORCE AND CONSOLIDATE ITS SOVEREIGN PRESENCE.\"     ALVARO GOMEZ HURTADO, 71, A \"DISSIDENT\" CONSERVATIVE, MAINTAINS THAT WITHOUT THE STRENGTHENING OF MORALS AND THE LAW -- \"THE ROOT OF OUR ILLS\" -- COEXISTENCE AND PROGRESS WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE.  HE PLEDGES TO RESCUE THOSE TWO VALUES.     GOMEZ HURTADO PRESENTED TO COLOMBIAN VOTERS A FIVE-POINT \"AGREEMENT ON BASIC ISSUES,\" INCLUDING LAW AND MORALS, JUSTICE, ECONOMIC PLANNING, AND ECOLOGY, AS HIS GOVERNMENT PLATFORM IF HE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT ON 27 MAY.     ANTONIO NAVARRO WOLFF, THE M-19 [19 APRIL MOVEMENT] PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, WHO REPLACED THE ASSASSINATED CARLOS PIZARRO, BELIEVES THAT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM ARE \"BASIC\" TO REACHING PEACE.     NAVARRO WOLFF, 41, HAS REITERATED THAT HE DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS, AND HE ALSO CONDEMNED THE CHAIN OF ATTACKS PERPETRATED BY DRUG TERRORISTS IN THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS.     REGARDING THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, HOWEVER, HE SAID THAT THEY REQUIRE \"MORE SERIOUS TREATMENT.\"  THEREFORE, IT IS BETTER TO HAVE \"A POOR DIALOGUE RATHER THAN A GOOD WAR,\" AND IF THAT DIALOGUE PRODUCES GOOD RESULTS \"WE MUST HOLD ON TO IT,\" HE SAID.     THE FOUR CANDIDATES AGREE ON REFORMING THE CONGRESS OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE CONSTITUTION BY CONVOKING A NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY. THEY ALSO SHARE OPINIONS ON THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC OPENING TOWARD INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, ACCESS TO FOREIGN INVESTMENT, AND PROMOTION OF AN \"AGRO-INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION\" WHICH WILL GUARANTEE A REDUCTION OR STABILIZATION OF THE RATE OF INFLATION.",

WHAT CAN THE POPULAR MOVEMENT DO?     [GONZALEZ] I BELIEVE THAT THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT IS CLOSING ALL THE ROADS TO A PEACEFUL SOLUTION OF THIS CONFLICT.  THROUGH REPRESSION IT IS CLOSING OFF THE POSSIBILITY OF LABOR UNIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS RESOLVING THEIR PROBLEMS PEACEFULLY.  THE GOVERNMENT IS CLOSING OFF THE POSSIBILITY OF NEGOTIATIONS.  THE ARMY AND THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT ARE OPPOSED TO TRUE NEGOTIATIONS.  THE PEOPLE HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE.  IN EL SALVADOR THERE IS A LATENT PATH, THE PATH OF ARMED ACTIONS.  AT THIS MOMENT, AS THIS GOVERNMENT INCREASES REPRESSION, ARMED ACTIONS BECOME INCREASINGLY LEGITIMATE, ARMED ACTIONS TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO THE CONFLICT, ARMED ACTIONS TO STOP THE REPRESSION BY THE REGIME.     THE WORKERS AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS AND LABOR UNIONS ARE ENTITLED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND THEIR LABOR BENEFITS.  DEFENSE IS LEGITIMATE.

THE ARMED FORCES AND THE GOVERNMENT HAVE PUBLICLY SAID THAT THE FMLN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ATTACKS.     [GONZALEZ] OUR ARMED ACTIONS ARE HIGHLY JUST AND HAVE POLITICAL MOTIVATIONS.

THE ATTACK ON THE ARMED FORCES STAFF INSTALLATIONS AND OTHER OPERATIONS AGAINST MILITARY TARGETS ARE OUR RESPONSIBILITY.  THE FMLN'S POLICY IS NOT TO ATTACK RELATIVES OF MILITARY MEN OR POLITICIANS.  THE HIGH COMMAND HAS BEEN TRYING TO CONFUSE THE PEOPLE HERE AND ABROAD.  WHAT IS ITS OBJECTIVE?  TO COVER UP ITS REPRESSIVE POLICY.  IT IS ESCALATING ITS ACTIONS.  IT HAS GONE FROM THE SELECTIVE CAPTURE AND MURDER OF LEADERS TO MASS ARRESTS, AND FROM MASS ARRESTS IT HAS MOVED INTO GENOCIDE AND INDISCRIMINATE ATTACKS.     IT IS CLEAR THAT ITS OBJECTIVE IS THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS.  THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT IN SAN JOSE.

A COMMUNIQUE BY THE GUATEMALAN NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY UNITY (URNG), RELEASED IN COSTA RICA, STRESSED THAT 126 ELITE TROOPS OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY, KNOWN AS KAIBILES, ARE COLLABORATING WITH SALVADORAN SOLDIERS TO PUT AN END TO THE OFFENSIVE BY GUERRILLAS OF THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN).     THE URNG CHARGE, ALSO PRESENTED BY THE FMLN, HAS BEEN CATEGORICALLY AND REPEATEDLY DENIED BY GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT SPOKESWOMAN CLAUDIA ARENAS.     THE REBEL COMMUNIQUE STATED: \"WE VIGOROUSLY CONDEMN THE INTERVENTION OF THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AGAINST THE GLORIOUS SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  WE WILL MAKE THE GUATEMALAN ARMY AND GOVERNMENT PAY DEARLY FOR THIS AGGRESSION.\"     THE NOTE WAS RELEASED SHORTLY AFTER SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED THE VICTORY OF HIS COUNTRY'S ARMY OVER THE FMLN, FOLLOWING FIERCE FIGHTING THAT LEFT APPROXIMATELY 1,000 DEAD AND MORE THAN 1,500 WOUNDED IN THE PAST 7 DAYS.     IN ADDITION, THE GUATEMALAN GUERRILLAS EXPRESSED SOLIDARITY \"WITH THE COMMUNITY OF JESUIT PRIESTS\" AND THEIR SORROW BECAUSE OF THE KILLING OF SIX OF THEIR MEMBERS, INCLUDING CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY RECTOR IGNACIO ELLACURIA AND TWO WOMEN, CARRIED OUT BY UNIFORMED MEN IN SAN SALVADOR ON 16 NOVEMBER.     THE URNG DECLARATION IS SIGNED BY COMMANDERS ROLANDO MORAN, GASPAR ILOM, AND PABLO MONSANTO.",

THE CALLER IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS JOHN JAIRO ARIAS TASCON.  HE CALLED THE CARACOL NETWORK IN MEDELLIN TO DENOUNCE THAT THE CHARGES AGAINST THE MEDELLIN CARTEL ARE PART OF A PLAN TO BLAME THEM FOR ALL VIOLENT ACTIONS IN THE COUNTRY.     THE AUTHORS OF THE ASSASSINATION ARE SECTORS WHO SEEK TO DESTABILIZE THE COUNTRY, ARIAS TASCON ADDED.     PIZARRO, FORMER LEADER OF THE 19 APRIL MOVEMENT (M-19), THE GUERRILLA GROUP THAT LAID DOWN ITS WEAPONS ON 9 MARCH, WAS KILLED BY THE IMPACT OF THREE BULLETS FIRED AT HIM ABOARD A COLOMBIAN AVIANCA FLIGHT THAT WAS EN ROUTE TO THE CITY OF BARRANQUILLA ALONG THE COUNTRY'S ATLANTIC COAST.     AFTER THE CRIME, AT 1100 (1600 GMT), AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS SAPATOCA CALLED CARACOL TO REPORT THAT THE KILLING HAD BEEN ORDERED BY FIDEL CASTANO AND HENRY PEREZ, HEADS OF THE EXTREME RIGHTIST PARAMILITARY MILITIAS.     SAPATOCA ADDED THAT CASTANO AND PEREZ PERPETRATED THE CRIME FOLLOWING ORDERS FROM THE EXTRADITABLES.     CASTANO WAS CONNECTED TO THE DEATH OF BERNARDO JARAMILLO, ALSO A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, FOR THE LEFTIST PATRIOTIC UNION (UP), ON 22 MARCH, ALTHOUGH AT THAT TIME IT WAS REPORTED THAT CASTANO HEADED A PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATION THAT DID NOT IMPLICATE THE EXTRADITABLES.     ON THAT OCCASION PABLO ESCOBAR, LEADER OF THE EXTRADITABLES AND THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, DENIED THAT THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS HAD KILLED JARAMILLO.     A CONFIDENTIAL REPORT DRAFTED RECENTLY BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY (DAS, COLOMBIAN SECRET POLICE), SAID THAT SOME ARMY AND POLICE MEMBERS COOPERATE WITH CASTANO'S CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION.     NAVARRO WOLFF, NUMBER TWO LEADER OF M-19, TOLD NEWSMEN TODAY AFTER PIZARRO WAS KILLED THAT HIS BURIAL MUST BE ATTENDED BY ALL THE COUNTRY, BECAUSE WE MUST REPUDIATE CRIME SUCH AS THIS.     NAVARRO WOLFF SAID THAT PIZARRO'S DEATH SHOWS THAT THE COUNTRY IS IN TURMOIL AND THAT IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO REBUILD THE COUNTRY. THERE IS NO SPACE EXCEPT FOR PAIN AND FOR IRE, HE ADDED.     THE BURIAL OF CARLOS MUST BE PEACEFUL, AS WAS M-19'S EXAMPLE OF PEACE GIVEN TO THE COUNTRY, HE ADDED.     IT IS HARD TO EXPLAIN HOW THINGS SUCH AS THIS OCCUR WHEN THE M-19 AND CARLOS PIZARRO WERE SETTING AN EXAMPLE OF PRUDENCE, TOLERANCE, AND UNDERSTANDING, NAVARRO SAID.     PIZARRO, A FORMER GUERRILLA COMMANDER WHO LED HIS ARMED GROUP TOWARD DEMOBILIZATION AFTER 17 MONTHS OF POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF VIRGILIO BARCO, TOLD NEWSMEN BEFORE BOARDING THE AIRCRAFT: WE ARE DOING WELL. THIS WAS A REFERENCE TO THE M-19 ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN.     PIZARRO STATED IN HIS LAST PUBLIC STATEMENT: I AM CERTAIN THAT WE WILL KNOW HOW TO WAGE OPPOSITION.  WE WILL ENGAGE IN A VERY PRETTY DEMOCRATIC PLAY WITH REGARD TO THE NEXT GOVERNMENT.  WE WILL PARTICIPATE IN BUILDING NEW COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY.     THE M-19 PARTICIPATED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE 11 MARCH ELECTIONS, BECOMING THE THIRD POLITICAL FORCE IN BOGOTA.     NOTHING HAS BEEN SAID YET CONCERNING THE BURIAL OF PIZARRO, WHO WAS BORN 39 YEARS AGO IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS AND WHO LEAVES THREE ORPHAN DAUGHTERS, AGED 12, 9, AND 4.",

[PONCE] I BELIEVE THAT SPECIFIC MEASURES WE HAVE ADOPTED HAVE GIVEN US GOOD RESULTS.  THEY HAVE LAUNCHED FOUR SA-7'S IN THE ZACATECOLUCA AREA; HOWEVER, OUR PILOTS HAVE SKILLFULLY AVOIDED THE ROCKETS OR MISSILES, WHICH DID NOT HIT THEIR AIRCRAFT.  WE ARE ADOPTING MEASURES THAT ARE GIVING RESULTS.  WE MUST ALSO CLARIFY THAT WE FEEL THAT SINCE THE LIGHT AIRCRAFT TRANSPORTING THESE MISSILES DID NOT HAVE A NORMAL LANDING AND THE MISSILES WERE NOT IN THEIR ORIGINAL PACKAGE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY SUFFERED SOME FUNCTIONAL DAMAGE WHEN THE PLANE CRASHED SOUTH OF ZACATECOLUCA.  THANK GOD, [WORDS INDISTINCT]     [REPORTER] DO YOU THINK THAT THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS CAN OPEN NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR RESUMING TALKS WITH THE FMLN?  DO YOU THINK THAT THIS SUMMIT COULD BRING ABOUT NEW STEPS TOWARD A DIALOGUE?     [PONCE] YES, I THINK THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR HAS OPENED THIS POSSIBILITY AND IS WILLING TO TALK ON A PERMANENT BASIS.  I THINK THAT AT THIS TIME IT WOULD BE A POSITIVE STEP IN THE POLITICAL FIELD.     HOWEVER, IN THE MILITARY FIELD, WHERE THE FMLN HAS ATTACKED US IN AN IRRATIONAL AND VIOLENT WAY IN THE MAIN CITIES, THE ARMED FORCES IS REPLYING, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO REPLY.  WE WILL COMPLETELY DEFEAT THE FMLN.     BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM OUR UNITS, WE HAVE INFLICTED 1,902 DEAD, 1,209 WOUNDED, AND 44 TERRORISTS HAVE DESERTED AND TURNED THEMSELVES IN TO THE AUTHORITIES.  WE HAVE CONFISCATED A LARGE NUMBER OF WEAPONS.  I WILL GIVE YOU THE QUANTITIES: 25 ANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILES -- ONE RED EYE AND 24 SA-7'S -- 915 RIFLES, 12 CARBINES, 11 SHOTGUNS, 156 GRENADE AND ROCKET LAUNCHERS, 49 MORTARS, 45 MACHINEGUNS, 41 SUBMACHINEGUNS, 67 REVOLVERS AND PISTOLS, 23 RADIOS, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF EXPLOSIVES.     I MUST STRESS THAT THE FMLN HAS GATHERED ALL THESE WEAPONS WITH SUPPPORT FROM ABROAD.  IT IS A LARGE ARSENAL.     I MUST ALSO NOTE THAT MANY OF THE WEAPONS WE FOUND HAD BEEN ABANDONED, WHICH MEANS THAT THE FMLN HAS HAD MANY DESERTIONS.  WE HAVE ALSO FOUND WEAPONS IN HOUSES, THANKS TO THE COLLABORATION OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.     WE HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE FMLN HAS KIDNAPPED A LARGE NUMBER OF YOUTHS HERE IN THE SAN SALVADOR AREA AND MAINLY IN USULUTAN, AS WELL AS IN CHALATENANGO.  THIS MEANS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO FILL IN THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES THEY HAVE SUFFERED WITH YOUTHS.  THIS ALSO MEANS THAT THEIR EFFICIENCY WILL BE VERY LOW.     [REPORTER] I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS A LEAFLET ISSUED BY THE AIR FORCE, WHICH WAS DROPPED FROM AIRPLANES AND ALSO DISTRIBUTED ON THE STREETS.  THE LEAFLET URGES SALVADORAN PATRIOTS TO DEFEND THEIR HOMELAND, THEIR PROPERTIES, AND LIVES.  IT ALSO SAYS THAT IF NECESSARY, TERRORISTS MUST BE KILLED, AS WELL AS THEIR INTERNATIONALIST ALLIES.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THIS LEAFLET? IS IT NOT AN INVITATION TO KILL FOREIGNERS IN THIS COUNTRY?     [PONCE] I DO NOT THINK SO, BECAUSE THE LEAFLETS MENTION INTERNATIONALISTS, WHO ARE FIGHTING ALONG WITH THE FMLN.  [CONTINUED]",

BOTERO SAID THAT INITIAL INVESTIGATIONS HAVE REVEALED THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA PLANNED AND ORDERED THE ATTACK ON JARAMILLO OSSA.  GEN. BOTERO TOLD REPORTERS THAT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL CONTRACTED THE SERVICES OF AN ORGANIZATION OF HIRED ASSASSINS AND SENT THEM TO BOGOTA TO ASSASSINATE THE UP LEADER.     HE ADDED THAT ESCOBAR GAVIRIA ORDERED THE DELIVERY OF AN INITIAL SUM OF 300,000 PESOS TO A THIRD PERSON AFTER THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED AT EL DORADO AIRPORT'S PEDESTRIAN OVERPASS IN BOGOTA.     THE DEFENSE MINISTER SAID THAT MINUTES AFTER THE KILLING THE DAS [ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT OF SECURITY] INTELLIGENCE SERVICE INTERCEPTED AN ESCOBAR GAVIRIA CONVERSATION IN MEDELLIN.  HE WAS ORDERING HIS ACCOMPLICES TO PAY 300,000 PESOS TO A THIRD PERSON LINKED TO THE PAID ASSASSIN WHO KILLED THE UP LEADER.     BOTERO ALSO DISCLOSED THAT THE ASSASSIN IS A 16-YEAR-OLD YOUTH WHO CARRIED A FALSE IDENTIFICATION CARD UNDER THE NAME OF JAIRO ALBERTO RESTREPO POSADA.     MEANWHILE, ANONYMOUS CALLS WERE RECEIVED BY VARIOUS BOGOTA MEDIA TODAY.  THE CALLERS WERE ATTRIBUTING THE ATTACK ON UP LEADER JARAMILLO OSSA TO A SO-CALLED GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA COMMANDO GROUP. IN THESE CALLS, IT WAS SAID THAT THE MEDELLIN CARTEL DECIDED TO RESUME THE WAR BECAUSE FOR FIVE MONTHS IT OFFERED TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS GOVERNMENT, AND THE ONLY RESPONSE IT RECEIVED WAS TO URGE CARTEL MEMBERS TO TURN THEMSELVES IN TO JUSTICE.     IN ADDITION, THREATS WERE MADE AGAINST OTHER COLOMBIAN POLITICAL FIGURES SUCH AS LIBERAL PARTY CANDIDATE CESAR GAVIRIA TRUJILLO. THE CALLERS SAID THAT THE EXTRADITABLES RELEASED KIDNAPPED PEOPLE, DELIVERED LABORATORIES, AND LARGE QUANTITIES OF DYNAMITE AS PROOF OF THEIR INTENTION TO TALK, BUT THEY NEVER RECEIVED A REPLY FROM THE GOVERNMENT.     THE CALLERS SAID: WE ARE GOING TO TURN OURSELVES IN, BUT WE WILL BE DEAD WHEN WE DO SO.

MERINO DESCRIBED THE CULPRITS AS MURDEROUS BEASTS.     THE VICE PRESIDENT WENT TO THE MEDICAL-SURGICAL HOSPITAL OF THE SALVADORAN INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL SECURITY, TO WHICH DR GUERRERO WAS TAKEN AFTER THE ATTACK.  GUERRERO, WHO WAS AN ADVISER TO THE GOVERNMENTAL COMMISSION FOR SUPPORT TO THE DIALOGUE [COMISION DE APOYO GUBERNAMENTAL DE DIALOGO], WAS SHOT TO DEATH BY TERRORISTS AT THE INTERSECTION OF BOULEVARD DE LOS HEROES AND ALAMEDA JUAN PABLO II.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] WHAT THEY ARE SHOWING IS THAT THEY ARE BENT ON CARRYING OUT TOTALLY DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS TO LOWER THE CONFIDENCE OF THE POPULATION AND TO PROVOKE GENERAL PANIC.  I THINK THAT ALTHOUGH AS A GOVERNMENT WE HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED A CONCILIATORY POSITION TO ATTAIN PEACE IN EL SALVADOR, WE MUST ALSO MAKE A FIRMER DECISION TO TAKE STRONGER ACTION.  THE PEOPLE WHO COMMIT THESE WANTON ACTIONS ARE DERANGED PEOPLE.  THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND WORDS.  THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MUST RESPECT A LEGAL SYSTEM, OR A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS OR ONE OF HUMANIZATION.  THEY ARE SIMPLY BEASTS AND MURDERERS AND MUST BE TREATED AS SUCH.  [END RECORDING]     MERINO SAID THE MURDERERS MUST BE PUNISHED WITH THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE LAWS, AND THAT ONE OF THE TERRORISTS WHO WAS WOUNDED AND CAPTURED AT THE SITE OF THE CRIME IS UNDER INTERROGATION.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] ONE OF THE CRIMINALS WAS WOUNDED.  THIS WILL OBVIOUSLY ENABLE US TO OBTAIN SOME CLUES AS TO THE IDENTITY OF THE ACTUAL KILLERS AND OF THE MASTERMINDS OF THIS NEW MURDER, WHICH HAS SHOCKED SALVADORAN SOCIETY.     AS IN PREVIOUS CASES, WE ARE CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS IN THIS CASE.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO TAKE A FIRMER STAND, TO DO OUR UTMOST, AND TO REALIZE THAT IF NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO US THUS FAR, IT DOES NOT MEAN WE WILL NOT FALL VICTIM TO THESE MURDERERS.  IT IS BETTER TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS NOW THAN TO HAVE REGRETS LATER.  [END RECORDING]     MERINO SAID THAT THIS CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE PROMOTED BY THE TERRORIST HORDES HAS NOT ENDED.  CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THIS IS THIS BRUTAL AND COWARDLY MURDER, WHICH HAS AGAIN FILLED THE SUFFERING SALVADORAN PEOPLE WITH SORROW.",

ACCORDING TO MEMBERS OF THE UNIVERSITY STUDENT ASSOCIATION [AEU] OF SAN CARLOS DE GUATEMALA UNIVERSITY, THE STUDENTS LEADERS DECIDED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUOUS THREATS OF DEATH AND PERSECUTION AND DUE TO THE KIDNAPPING AND ASSASSINATION OF FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.     THE NAMES OF THE STUDENTS WHO FLED THE COUNTRY ARE BEING KEPT SECRET TO PROTECT THEIR RELATIVES WHO LIVE IN GUATEMALA CITY AND IN THE INTERIOR OF THE COUNTRY, THE SOURCES MAINTAINED.     THREE OF THE STUDENTS TRAVELED TO PANAMA, ONE TO MEXICO, AND ANOTHER TO COSTA RICA.     THIS MONTH, THE CORPSES OF FIVE ASSASSINATED AEU LEADERS WERE FOUND IN THE CAPITAL, SOME WITH SIGNS OF TORTURE.  SIX OTHER UNIVERSITY STUDENT LEADERS REMAIN KIDNAPPED.     BELISARIO POLO, STUDENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PANAMA, TODAY TOLD EFE THAT THE THREE AEU LEADERS ARRIVED IN THE COUNTRY LAST WEEKEND AND ARE LIVING IN PRIVATE HOUSES.     GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SAID THEY HAVE NO OFFICIAL REPORTS ON THE DEPARTURE OF THE HIGHEST AEU LEADERS.     THE DEPARTURE OF THE FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS LEADERS COINCIDES WITH THE VISIT TO GUATEMALA OF PETER KOOIJMANS, WHO YESTERDAY MET GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND ARMY OFFICERS TO GATHER INFORMATION.     DURING HIS MEETING WITH GOVERNMENT MINISTER ROBERTO VALLE, KOOIJMANS REQUESTED REPORTS ON THE INVESTIGATIONS THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONDUCTED ON THE CASE OF THE KIDNAPPED STUDENTS, THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAID.     THE KIDNAPPING AND ASSASSINATION OF THE FIVE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND THE THREATS AGAINST OTHER AEU MEMBERS HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED BY LEADERS FROM UNIVERSITIES IN MEXICO, HONDURAS, PERU, COLOMBIA, COSTA RICA, EL SALVADOR, NICARAGUA, AND PANAMA.     UNIVERSITY STUDENTS LEADERS FROM CANADA, ECUADOR, CHILE, AND THE FRG HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR SOLIDARITY AND DEMANDED THAT THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE THESE ASSASSINATIONAS.     THE AEU REQUESTED THE HIGHER UNIVERSITY COUNCIL TO SUSPEND CLASSES FOR THE CURRENT SEMESTER IN VIEW OF THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE GUATEMALA IS SUFFERING AND IN VIEW OF THE DEATH THREATS AGAINST THE MAIN STUDENT LEADERS.  AS A RESPONSE, THE CSU HAS DECIDED TO LET EACH ACADEMIC SECTION DECIDE THE STRATEGY IT WILL IMPLEMENT TO GET PROTECTION FROM THE VIOLENCE. SEVERAL OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY SCHOOLS HAVE MODIFIED THE EVENING SCHEDULE, AND MOST CLASSES HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO 2-HOURS PERIODS SO STUDENTS CAN RETURN HOME EARLY.     SEVERAL LABOR UNION ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CONDEMNED THE KIDNAPPING AND ASSASSINATION ON 15 SEPTEMBER OF EDUARDO ANTONIO LOPEZ PALENCIA, A STUDENT WHOSE CORPSE SHOWED SIGNS OF TORTURE.",

IN AN INDISPUTABLE EFFORT OF CLEAR FLEXIBILITY AND WILLINGNESS FOR PEACE, THE FMLN PRESENTED A PEACE PROPOSAL TO JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND.  THAT PROPOSAL IS AIMED AT TURNING ELECTIONS INTO A CONTRIBUTION TO PEACE.     TWO WEEKS HAVE PASSED SINCE WE PRESENTED OUR PROPOSAL, AND NEITHER THE GOVERNMENT NOR THE ARMED FORCES HAVE OFFICIALLY RESPONDED TO THE FMLN INITIATIVE.  THAT INITIATIVE HAS HAD THE SUPPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND OF OUR COUNTRY'S LARGEST GROUPS.     NEITHER THE GOVERNMENT NOR THE HIGH COMMAND HAVE RESPONDED TO THE PEOPLE'S OUTCRY AND WORLD EXPECTATIONS, WHICH ARE AWAITING A POSITIVE RESPONSE TO OUR PROPOSAL.     ON THE CONTRARY, THE GOVERNMENT, ITS ARMED FORCES, AND THE MEMBERS OF THEIR SQUADS DISGUISED IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES CONTINUE THEIR DIRTY WAR AGAINST THE PEOPLES MOVEMENT AND THEIR WIDESPREAD WAR IN THE COUNTRYSIDE.     THE NATIONAL GUARD [WORD INDISTINCT] MURDERED UNIVERSITY STUDENT MARIO FLORES, WHOSE BODY WAS LEFT ON A HIGHWAY NEAR THE PORT OF ACAJUTLA.  MEANWHILE, NATIONAL POLICE MEMBERS WHO WERE DRESSED IN CIVILIAN CLOTHES SEIZED UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HUGO MARTINEZ AND RAUL RAMIREZ, WHO ARE STILL MISSING.     JAIME ESTEVEZ, A MEMBER OF THE BREAD, LAND, WORK, AND FREEDOM MOVEMENT [MPTL] WAS TAKEN TO THE USULUTAN JAIL TO BE MURDERED AND THE CRIME WAS SUPPOSED TO GO UNNOTICED.     MEANWHILE, ACCORDING TO REPORTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK COOPERATIVES, FENACOA, ON 31 JANUARY, OROMONTIQUE BATTALION TROOPS OF THE 6TH INFANTRY BRIGADE COMMANDED BY LIEUTENANT PACHECHO MURDERED PEASANTS VICTOR MANUEL VASQUEZ AND RAFAEL ROMERO.  THE TROOPS FAKED A CLASH AT HORCONES DE BERLIN CANTON TO MURDER THOSE PEASANTS.     ON 4 JANUARY, LUCIA AND MARIA ASUNCION ROMERO, AND MINOR PEDRO GONZALEZ ERAZO WERE CAPTURED AT THE AHUACHAPAN BUS STATION BY ARMY TROOPS COMMANDED BY MURDERER COLONEL CANAS.

WE MUST CALL FOR NATIONAL UNITY.  WE MUST ALL COOPERATE TO SAVE OUR HOMELAND FROM THE TERRORIST AGGRESSION.  WE MUST ALL UNITE TO ACHIEVE PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, ALWAYS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE SITUATION OUR COUNTRY IS GOING THROUGH.     WE MUST SUPPORT OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, OUR INSTITUTIONS, AND WE MUST TOTALLY REJECT THE FMLN TERRORIST FORCES.  WE MUST FACE THOSE FORCES THROUGH A UNITED FRONT.

BRIEFLY, WE MUST UNITE TO LIVE IN A DE JURE STATE IN WHICH THE PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN HARMONY AND TRANQUILLITY.     IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY THAT ALL POLITICAL PARTIES JOIN EFFORTS, NOT AROUND A GOVERNMENT OR AN INSTITUTION, BUT FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE THEIR DEAREST GOALS.     WE ARE RECEIVING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S SUPPORT.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS SUPPORTING SALVADORAN DEMOCRACY.  WE HAVE RECEIVED ENCOURAGING MESSAGES FROM COUNTRIES SUCH AS GREAT BRITAIN, WHICH HAS VIGOROUSLY CONDEMNED THE FMLN TERRORIST ACTION.  WE HAVE RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM THE EEC, IN WHICH THAT GROUP IS TELLING THE FMLN THAT THE ARMED STRUGGLE IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS AND THAT TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS, WE MUST FIRST HAVE PEACE AND THEN ACHIEVE THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THOSE GOALS MUST BE ATTAINED THROUGH A PEACE PROCESS.  THE GOVERNMENT HAD ALREADY BEGAN THAT PROCESS AND THE FMLN TRIED TO BREAK IT.  THE PEACE PROCESS MUST BE BASED ON THE ESQUIPULAS II AGREEMENT AND ESPECIALLY ON THE TELA AGREEMENT.     WE HAVE ALSO WITNESSED HOW DIFFERENT POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL TENDENCIES HAVE BECOME UNIFIED IN OTHER COUNTRIES.  [CONTINUED]",

PATRICIO AYLWIN HAS BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF CHILE. I CONGRATULATE HIM AND HIS FOLLOWERS, AND I WISH HIM SUCCESS IN HIS GOVERNMENT, FOR THE GOOD OF CHILE AND CHILEANS. HIS TRIUMPH IS NOT A DEFEAT FOR OUR IDEAS. MY CAMPAIGN WAS CONSTANTLY FOCUSED ON THE IDEA OF FREEDOM -- BOTH POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC -- PRIVATE PROPERTY, AND THE SOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY.  IT HAD TO BE THIS WAY BECAUSE THIS IS THE FUTURE CHILEANS WANT, AND IF OUR IDEAS GAIN GROUND, THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE NAME OF THE MAN CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING THEM.     BUT THOSE IDEAS MUST BE DISSEMINATED EVEN MORE WITH INCESSANT WORK. IN A DEMOCRACY, THE OPPOSITION ALSO GOVERNS.  HISTORY HAS PLACED US IN THE CONSTRUCTIVE OPPOSITION FOR THE NEXT 4 YEARS. WE WILL BE WILLING TO COOPERATE FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY, BUT WE WILL STAY ALERT TO DEFEND OUR VISION OF THE FUTURE. I AM CONVINCED THAT AN INTELLIGENT OPPOSITION CAN DO MUCH FOR THE COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY IF THAT OPPOSITION IS BACKED BY THE NEARLY 2 MILLION PEOPLE WHO TODAY SUPPORTED MY CANDIDACY.     THE WORK THAT LIES AHEAD WILL TO A LARGE EXTENT BE CARRIED OUT IN CONGRESS. THE INFORMATION NOW AVAILABLE SUGGESTS THAT THE PACT FOR DEMOCRACY AND PROGRESS HAS GAINED A VALUABLE REPRESENTATION IN BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS. LET MY CONGRATULATIONS GO TO THE FUTURE DEPUTIES AND SENATORS OF DEMOCRACY AND PROGRESS. I SEIZE THIS OCCASION TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY CAN COUNT ON MY SUPPORT.     I AM SATISFIED WITH THE NUMBER OF VOTES I WON, CONSIDERING THE UNFAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES. I AM SATISFIED WITH THE ENTHUSIASTIC AND GENEROUS WORK CARRIED OUT BY MY ELECTORAL STAFF AND BY THE POLITICAL PARTIES.  I THANK THEM FOR THEIR SUPPORT.  I WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK EACH OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO VOTED FOR ME. TO THE MILLIONS OF CHILEAN MEN AND WOMEN WHO IN SUNSHINE OR RAIN THROUGHOUT CHILE FILLED UP STADIUMS, PLAZAS, AND STREETS, CHANTING OUT SLOGANS FOR THE FUTURE; TO THOSE WHO SAW THE STREET WITH THE SYMBOL OF THE STAR OF HOPE; TO THOSE WHO PASTED MY PICTURE ON WALLS, WINDOWS, AND NOTEBOOKS; TO THOSE WHO ENCOURAGED ME IN THIS TIRESOME BUT MOVING CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBRACE, A HANDSHAKE, OR A SMILE; TO ALL THOSE I WANT TO EXPRESS MY DEEPEST THANKS.  I WILL KEEP THEM IN MY HEART FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.     WHEN WE INITIATED THIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN -- AN HONOR THAT YOU KNOW I NEVER SOUGHT -- I TOLD MY FOLLOWERS THAT JUST LIKE CLIMBING A MOUNTAIN, THERE WERE MOMENTS OF ADVANCE, FATIGUE, AND FALLS, BUT I TRUSTED THAT, MUSTERING ALL OUR ENERGY, WE WOULD OUTDO OURSELVES AND REACH THE SUMMIT. I AM SATISFIED BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT EACH ONE OF US, AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A POLITICAL FORCE, HAVE OUTDONE OURSELVES AND CLIMBED A LON WAY UP THE MOUNTAIN, BATTLING FOR OUR IDEAS AND FOR VOTES. WE DID NOT REACH THE SUMMIT, TRUE, BUT THIS MUST NOT DISMAY US. TODAY WE ARE CLOSER TO THE SUMMIT THAN WHEN WE STARTED.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYONE. GOOD NIGHT.",

THAT IS THE MAIN ASPECT OF THE GENEVA AGREEMENT.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME DEADLINES WILL NOT BE MET. IF DEADLINES ARE SET AND THE TIME FOR IMPLEMENTING THEM EXPIRES, THEN THIS IS TANTAMOUNT TO WASTING TIME.  THIS THEN LEADS TO STEPS BEING DEMANDED THAT IN REALITY DEPEND ON THE POLITICAL AGREEMENTS THAT ARE REACHED AND NOT THE DEADLINES FOR REACHING THEM.     THEREFORE, ACCORDING TO THE AGENDA AND THE TIMETABLE AGREED TO HERE IN CARACAS, THE ACCENT IS ON THE POLITICAL AGREEMENTS.  THOSE AGREEMENTS HAVE TO DO WITH CHANGES WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES. EVERYTHING RELATED TO THE ARMED FORCES MUST BE CHANGED.  EVERY FACTOR CONCERNING THE ARMED FORCES MUST BE REVIEWED FROM A CERTAIN POINT OR PERSPECTIVE.  CHANGES ARE NECESSARY; CHANGES MUST BE MADE AND THOSE CHANGES MUST BE SIGNIFICANT. THESE CHANGES MUST COMPLETELY TRANSFORM THE ARMED FORCES, BEGINNING WITH ITS ROLE AND INFLUENCE IN DETERMINING THE COUNTRY'S POLICIES AND GUIDELINES.     WE HAVE BEEN PRESENTING PROPOSALS IN THIS REGARD FOR SOME TIME. THE TOPIC OF DEMOCRATIZATION IS CLOSELY LINKED TO THE TOPIC OF THE ARMED FORCES, TO ITS PURGING, ITS REDUCTION, AND IN SUM, ITS END.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTRY WILL NOT ALWAYS NEED THE ARMED FORCES.  AS WITH ANY INSTITUTION OR HISTORICAL FACTOR, IT EMERGES, IT IS MAINTAINED FOR A CERTAIN TIME, AND THEN IT TENDS TO DISAPPEAR.     THE COUNTRY MUST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP. IT CANNOT CONTINUE ALONG THE SAME PATH BECAUSE THIS WOULD ONLY REPRESENT EXPENSES AND A HEAVY BURDEN FOR THE COUNTRY.     FOR SEVERAL DECADES, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE MEANT ABSENCE OF LIBERTY, REAL SECURITY, AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE CIVILIAN SOCIETY TO DECIDE THE COUNTRY'S PATH.  ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO A MERE FORMALITY, WHERE THOSE WHO WERE NOT ELECTED RUN THE COUNTRY.     THE COUNTRY IS NOW GOING THROUGH A DRAMA THAT HAS ALSO SHOCKED THE INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC, THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS.  EVERYONE IS AWAITING THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS AND HOPING THAT THOSE WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CRIME WILL BE PUNISHED.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CASE OF JESUIT PRIESTS IS REALLY GRAVE; IT IS A DRAMA THAT REFLECTS THE DRAMA OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE'S HISTORY IN THE CURRENT CENTURY. [CONTINUED]",

THE TECHNICAL INVESTIGATION COMMISSION HAS DETERMINED THAT SOME MILITARY WERE REPORTEDLY INVOLVED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUITS AND THEIR TWO MAIDS, WHICH TOOK PLACE AT DAYBREAK ON 16 NOVEMBER, AS REPORTED BY PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON 7 JANUARY.     \"THE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN REST ASSURED THE SALVADORAN JUDICIARY SYSTEM WILL NOT HESITATE TO ENFORCE THE LAW UPON THE AUTHORS OF THIS HORRIBLE CRIME,\" DR GUTIERREZ POINTED OUT.     GUTIERREZ SAID HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED OR THEIR MILITARY RANKS, BECAUSE THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CRIMINAL ACTIONS IS STILL CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS AND HAS NOT PRESENTED ITS REPORT TO THE TRIBUNAL.     HOWEVER, GENERAL PROSECUTOR DR MAURICIO EDUARDO COLORADO MAINTAINED THAT THE MILITARY SUSPECTS \"ARE REGROUPED AND HAVE BEEN PUT IN CUSTODY.\" HOWEVER, HE DID NOT REVEAL THE NAMES OR THE MILITARY RANKS OF THE SUSPECTS.

ASKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE, JUSTICE MINISTER DR OSCAR ALFREDO SANTAMARIA, PRESIDENT OF THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE CRIMINAL ACTIONS SAID: \"WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE MOST RECENT INFORMATION ON THIS CASE WAS ANNOUNCED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC A FEW DAYS AGO.\"  HE REFUSED TO MAKE ANY FURTHER STATEMENTS.     NEW UCA [CENTRAL AMERICAN UNIVERSITY] RECTOR JESUIT FRANCISCO ESTRADA ADMITTED PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS TAKEN \"A STEP FORWARD\" BY UNMASKING THE SUSPECTS IN THIS CRIME, \"BECAUSE HIS ETHIC PRINCIPLES DO NOT TOLERATE SUCH ATROCITIES.\"     ESTRADA SAID HE UNDERSTANDS WHY CRISTIANI, DURING HIS 7 JANUARY SPEECH, DID NOT GIVE ANY NAMES, \"BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE STILL BEING CONDUCTED.\"  MOREOVER, THERE MUST NOT ONLY BE ONE SUSPECT, BUT RATHER SEVERAL.\"     BEFORE MEETING WITH THE REPORTERS, THE UCA RECTOR MET WITH OFFICIALS FROM SCOTLAND YARD.  A FEW DAYS AGO, HE ALSO MET SPANISH, CANADIAN, AND U.S.  POLICEMEN WHO, AT THE GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST, ARE ASSISTING THE SALVADORAN COMMISSION IN CHARGE OF CLARIFYING THIS CASE.",

AT 1900, A GOES [SPECIAL OPERATIONS GROUP] TEAM SURROUNDED THE RANCH.  AN AGENT MAKES SURE THE MAIN GATE IS NOT ELECTRICALLY WIRED, AND THE DECISION TO FORCIBLY ENTER THE HOUSE IS MADE. THEY ALL COVER ONE ANOTHER AS THEY TAKE THEIR POSITIONS.  THESE MEN ARE PERFECTLY TRAINED FOR THIS SORT OF WORK.  THESE IS A LIGHT INSIDE THE RANCH HOUSE, SO THEY ASSUME SOMEONE IS INSIDE.  TENSION RISES IN VIEW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ARMED CONFRONTATION.  AS HE APPROACHES THE RANCH, THE COMMANDER DECIDES TO STORM IT.  MOMENTS LATER, SEVERAL MEN OPEN THE DOOR WITHOUT OFFERING RESISTANCE AND SURRENDER TO THE AUTHORITIES.     A PATROL ENTERS QUICKLY AND CONTROLS EVERY CORNER OF THE RANCH.  OTHER UNIFORMED MEN SUPPORT THE OPERATION FROM OUTSIDE.  THEY UNSUCCESSFULLY LOOK FOR CACHES.  THESE THREE WORKERS WHO WERE DOING REPAIRS AT THE RANCH WERE DETAINED AS A PRECAUTION IN THE MAIN HALL.  MEANWHILE, THE SEARCH CONTINUES IN OTHER AREAS OF THE HOUSE.  THREE SAFES WERE HIDDEN IN DIFFERENT ROOMS OF THE RANCH HOUSE.  ONE OF THE SAFES WAS BUILT INTO ONE OF THE EIGHT MARBLE-TILED BATHROOMS.  THE HUGE KITCHEN WAS TEMPORARILY AT THE WORKERS' DISPOSAL.  NEAR THE MASTER BEDROOM WAS A LARGE SWIMMING POOL WITH A GROUND-LEVEL WINDOW FROM THE SAUNA AND JACUZZI AREA.  THERE WERE SEVERAL GAME ROOMS AND TENNIS AND SQUASH COURTS IN THE HOUSE.

THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY MET THIS MORNING WITH PRESIDENT DUARTE, AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES; DEFENSE MINISTER GENERAL CARLOS EUGENIO VIDES CASANOVA; AND ARMED FORCES CHIEF OF STAFF COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE.     THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND TRUSTS THE POLITICAL PARTIES' MATURITY AND WILL SUPPORT ANY RESOLUTION THEY APPROVE CONCERNING THE FMLN PROPOSAL, THE DEFENSE MINISTER SAID FOLLOWING A PRIVATE MEETING WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY'S DIRECTORATE BOARD AND POLITICAL COMMISSION.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [GEN VIDES] I TOLD THE POLITICAL PARTIES: IF YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM ADVANTAGES SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR CANDIDATES TO WIN, GO AHEAD AND DO IT.  THEY MUST DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT TO GIVE AWAY THE ADVANTAGES OR NOT; BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE UNJUST.  A DEATH SQUAD MIGHT SAY: WE DO NOT WANT PEACE AND WE WILL SET OFF BOMBS UNTIL THE OTHERS CHANGE THEIR MINDS.     THIS IS NOT THE CASE RIGHT NOW.  WE WOULD BE SIMPLY ESTABLISHING A PRECEDENT.  THAT IS THE MAIN DANGER.  IF THE CONSTITUTION IS CHANGED AT WILL TODAY THEN IT CAN BE CHANGED AGAIN TOMORROW, AND AGAIN UNTIL THINGS ARE JUST AS THE REBELS WANT THEM. [END RECORDING]     THE MEETING WAS ALSO ATTENDED BY NAPOLEON DUARTE, IN HIS ROLE AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES.     [BEGIN RECORDING] [DUARTE] I AM HERE AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES.  I FULLY SUPPORT THE ARMED FORCES' DECISION CONCERNING ITS UNITY AND THE NEED TO [WORDS INDISTINCT] CONSTITUTION, AND THE WARNING THAT THE ARMED FORCES WILL NOT ADOPT POSITIONS TO HINDER THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN TOO MUCH BLOODSHED AND TOO MANY LIVES LOST ALREADY. [END RECORDING]     IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE FMLN PROPOSAL WAS THOROUGHLY ANALYZED DURING THE MEETING, AND IT WAS AGREED THAT THE CONSTITUTION CANNOT BE VIOLATED TO FAVOR MINORITY GROUPS' POSITIONS.     THE DEFENSE MINISTER ADDED:  THE ARMED FORCES ARE STRONGER THAN EVER. HE ALSO REFERRED TO THE U.S. VICE PRESIDENT'S VISIT AND SAID THAT HIS VIEWS COINCIDE WITH THE ARMED FORCES' GOALS, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING HUMAN RIGHTS.     THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND'S VISIT TO THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY IS CONSIDERED THE SECOND STEP TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO THE FMLN'S PROPOSAL TO THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY.  THE FIRST STEP WAS TO CALL A MEETING OF THE THE POLITICAL PARTIES, WHICH WAS NOT ATTENDED BY THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY BUT SERVED AS THE BASIS FOR FUTURE MEETINGS IN A SO-CALLED NEUTRAL PLACE.

THE MASSACRE AGAINST THE SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION [FENASTRAS] WAS PLANNED IN COLD BLOOD.  THE SITE AND THE MOMENT WHEN THE FENASTRAS LEADERS WERE MEETING HAD BEEN SELECTED.     2.  WE HAVE TRUSTWORTHY INFORMATION FROM OUR INTELLIGENCE ORGANS THAT THIS ACTION WAS ORDERED BY COLONEL PONCE, THAT CRISTIANI KNEW ABOUT IT AND APPROVED IT, AND THAT IT WAS CARRIED OUT BY COLONEL ELENA FUENTE AS THE HEAD OF THE MORBID DEATH SQUAD OF THE ARMY'S 1ST INFANTRY BRIGADE IN RESPONSE TO OUR MILITARY ATTACK ON THE ARMY STAFF.  THIS BEHAVIOR BY CRISTIANI SHOULD SURPRISE NO ONE.  TERRORISM IS AN OLD PRACTICE OF THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA].     ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO, ARENA ASSASSINS TRIED TO KILL THE PRESIDENT OF THE MORTGAGE BANK, MR MASON, FOR NOT FOLLOWING THEIR ORDERS.     3.  THE PEOPLE DEMAND THE RESIGNATION OF CHIEF OF STAFF COL EMILIO PONCE BECAUSE HIS RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS CRIMINAL ACTION IS REAL.     4.  THE FMLN HAS PRUDENTLY TAKEN TIME BEFORE ADOPTING A DEFINITE POSITION.  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES HAVE ADOPTED AN IRRESPONSIBLE ATTITUDE AND HAVE BRAZENLY ACCUSED THE FMLN OF THE CRIMES THEY COMMIT.     IN VIEW OF THIS ATTITUDE AND OF THE PEOPLE'S INDIGNATION, WE HAVE TO PREVENT OUR PRESENCE AT THE DIALOGUE FROM BEING USED TO COVER UP THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS MASSACRE AND TO ENHANCE THE MASK OF MODERATOR AND NEGOTIATOR THAT CRISTIANI HAS BEEN USING TO SECURE POLITICAL SUPPORT AND U.S. FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO EXTEND THE WAR.     IN SAN JOSE, SPEAKING ON ITS VIEW OF THE WAR, THE GOVERNMENT SAID THAT IT CONSIDERS POPULAR MOVEMENTS AS SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS OF THE FMLN, AND THEREFORE, AS ENEMIES OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THE ARMED CONFLICT.     WE DEMANDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT DELEGATION GIVE US A LIST OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS, BUT TO NO AVAIL.  THE TERRORIST ATTACKS AND MASSACRES ARE NOW YIELDING THE LISTS THAT WERE DENIED TO US AT THE DIALOGUE TABLE.     EVEN BEFORE THE SAN JOSE MEETING, THE GOVERNMENT HAD GREATLY INCREASED ITS REPRESSION.  SINCE THE MEETING, IT HAS INCREASED ITS DETENTIONS AND ATTACKED THE RESIDENCES OF LEADERS OF THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT AND THE UDN [NATIONALIST DEMOCRATIC UNION], UNIVERSITY, FECMASAN [MSGR OSCAR ARNULFO ROMERO FEDERATION OF COMMITTEES OF MOTHERS AND RELATIVES], AND FENASTRAS.  MEANWHILE, CRISTIANI IS MAINTAINING HIS HYPOCRITICAL POSITION OF MODERATION.     THE MASSACRES, DETENTIONS, AND REPRESSION OF EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS, THE REPATRIATED, UNIVERSITIES, LABOR UNIONS, PEASANT COOPERATIVES, MOTHERS' ORGANIZATIONS, AND OTHER SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION SHOW THAT THE WAR OF THE ARMED FORCES, GOVERNMENT, AND ARENA IS AIMED AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND, THEREFORE, THESE GROUPS CANNOT AND WILL NOT REMAIN IDLE.     THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE UP ARMS AND EXERCISE THEIR LEGITIMATE DEFENSE.  THE ARMED PEOPLE'S AND REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE HEADED BY THE FMLN IS JUST, LEGITIMATE, AND NECESSARY.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] TWO-FACED CRISTIANI ADMINISTRATION, THE FMLN HAS DECIDED TO IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THE DIALOGUE OBSERVERS AND THE CHURCH, WHICH IS THE MEDIATOR, TO DEMAND THROUGH THEM GUARANTEES FOR OPPOSITION CIVIC AND LABOR GROUPS AND A REVIEW OF THE CURRENT CONDITIONS OF THE DIALOGUE, NEGOTIATION PROCESS, AND ITS PROSPECTS.  MEANWHILE, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO SUSPEND OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE CARACAS MEETING.

COLONEL ARMANDO SANTAGORDA, IN A STATEMENT TO PANAMERICANA, SAID THAT HIS GROUP IS SUPPORTED BY THE CHIEF OF POLICE, WHO HAS GIVEN PRECISE INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL POLICEMEN TO COOPERATE IN THE INVESTIGATIONS.     MOREOVER, HE SAID THAT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE ARRIVAL IN THE PAST FEW HOURS OF SPECIALIZED U.S. POLICEMEN, ALLEGEDLY HERE TO COOPERATE IN THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT, SO FAR, ARE UNDER THE COMMAND AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BOLIVIAN POLICE FORCES.     HOWEVER, SANTAGORDA ASSERTED THAT THE INSTITUTION, IN COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS, IS IN PERMANENT CONTACT WITH POLICE FORCES OF OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH INTERPOL.     HE SAID THAT REGARDING THE CASE OF THE MURDERED U.S.  CITIZENS, THE POLICE ARE ALSO EXCHANGING INFORMATION BECAUSE THE INCIDENT IS OF AN INTERNATIONAL NATURE. HE SAID THAT HE BASED HIS DECLARATIONS ON THE PRELIMINARY INFORMATION OBTAINED SHORTLY AFTER THE CRIME.     SANTAGORDA SAID THAT FOUR PERUVIANS SUSPECTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING INVESTIGATED, AND THEY WILL HAVE TO JUSTIFY THEIR PRESENCE IN BOLIVIA.",

THE FMLN PLANS THAT THE ARMED FORCES RECENTLY SEIZED INCLUDE A STRATEGY IN WHICH THE FMLN IS TO CREATE CONFUSION AMONG THE POPULATION BY NOT CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF ACTIONS AND CRIMES.  UNDER THESE GUIDELINES, THE FMLN HAS NOT CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS ACTIONS, TO INSINUATE...[CHANGES THOUGHT] TO CREATE CONFUSION OR GIVE THE IMPRESSION THIS IS A VIOLENT SITUATION THAT HAS ARISEN BETWEEN POLITICAL GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY.     FORTUNATELY THERE IS EVIDENCE.  THE ARMED FORCES HAVE THE DOCUMENTS THAT PROVE THAT THIS IS A STRATEGY CARRIED OUT BY TERRORIST GROUPS TO PERPETRATE THIS KIND OF ACTION AND PROVOKE A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE POLITICAL AND DEMOCRATIC FORCES IN THE COUNTRY.     OTHER VALUABLE INFORMATION HAS BEEN UNCOVERED, BUT I BELIEVE IT IS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE PUBLIC SECURITY AUTHORITIES TO REVEAL THIS. TERRORISTS HAVE RECENTLY ISSUED DECLARATIONS REVEALING THIS STRATEGY, THEIR MODUS OPERANDI, AND THE PLANS THEY HAVE FOR THE NEAR FUTURE. THEY HAVE PLANS TO CONTINUE DEALING BLOWS AGAINST THE NEW ADMINISTRATION THROUGH ITS OFFICIALS TO FORCE CONDITIONS FOR NEGOTIATIONS IN THE NEAR FUTURE -- AS THEY DID WITH FORMER PRESIDENT DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT. [END RECORDING]     VICE PRESIDENT MERINO ALSO REFERRED TO ANOTHER TOPIC IN THE NEWS, THE ANTITERRORIST LAW:     [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] WE UNDERSTAND THE BILL HAS ALREADY BEEN SENT TO THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.  THERE IS [WORDS INDISTINCT] FOR THE DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY, AND ANOTHER ONE THAT REFERS TO THE ANTITERRORIST LAW.  THE TRUTH IS THAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS BEEN QUITE CLEAR IN ITS POSITION, WHICH WAS STATED BY THE VICE PRESIDENCY.     THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS CLEARLY STATED IT CANNOT LET THESE PEOPLE CONTINUE OPERATING WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS OR CONTROLS, VIOLATING THE LAW, DISRUPTING SOCIAL LIFE, AND DIRECTLY AFFECTING THE [WORDS INDISTINCT].  THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PEOPLE MUST BE PROTECTED BY EFFECTIVE LAWS SO THE PUBLIC SECURITY FORCES CAN CONTROL THE SITUATION AND SO THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE NOT INTERPRETED AS AN ABUSE OF AUTHORITY.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] PENAL CODE THAT CONTEMPLATES ALL THE SENTENCES FOR TERRORIST CRIMES; HOWEVER, THEY HAVE PROVED INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE THEY MAY LACK THE PROCEDURES NEEDED IN OUR CURRENT SITUATION. THOSE LAWS DATE BACK MANY DECADES; IT WAS NEVER FORESEEN THAT EL SALVADOR COULD REACH THE CURRENT DETERIORATED SITUATION, IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE KILLED AND THE CULPRITS CALMLY WALK AWAY.  NEWSPAPERS [WORDS INDISTINCT] SAY THAT SINCE WE ARE AT WAR, IT IS EASY FOR THEM TO KILL.     [REPORTER] IT IS RUMORED THAT THE LAW [PASSAGE INDISTINCT].     [MERINO] THE PROVISIONS ALREADY EXIST; ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS HARMONIZE THEM.  WE MUST FULFILL OUR OBLIGATION.  THE CONSTITUTION [WORDS INDISTINCT] STATED THAT EVERY SECONDARY LAW SHOULD BE HARMONIZED WITH THE CONSTITUTION.  IN THIS CASE, THE PENAL CODE, THE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED TO A CERTAIN POINT, AND IT IS IMPERATIVE -- IF WE ARE GOING TO ABIDE BY THE CONSTITUTION -- TO ADAPT THEM TO OUR SITUATION.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND NO OFFICIAL OF A FRIENDLY COUNTRY CAN INTERFERE WITH THIS.     I RECENTLY TOLD SOME JOURNALISTS WHO ARE MY FRIENDS THAT VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE'S GOAL WAS TO COME AND REAFFIRM HIS GOVERNMENT'S SUPPORT OF THE NEW SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  HE DID IT ON THIS DATE BECAUSE ON 1 JUNE HE WAS IN CHARGE OF THE U.S. PRESIDENCY WHILE PRESIDENT BUSH WAS IN EUROPE.  HIS VISIT TO EL SALVADOR WAS NOT A MERE COINCIDENCE.  HE CAME TO REAFFIRM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT CRISTIANI'S GOVERNMENT. [END RECORDING]",

LAST YEAR, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL STATISTICS, THERE WERE 4,600 VICTIMS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE. ABOUT HALF OF THOSE KILLED WERE PEASANTS.  AN \"INTERNAL WAR,\" UNLEASHED BY THE OLIGARCHY MANY YEARS AGO, IS BEING WAGED AGAINST THEM.  THE ACTIVISTS OF THE COALITION OF LEFT-WING PARTIES AND ORGANIZATIONS, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMUNISTS -- THE PATRIOTIC UNION -- COME NEXT, AFTER THE PEASANTS.  THE PEOPLE KILLED INCLUDE JAIME PARDO LEAL, PRESIDENT OF ITS NATIONAL COORDINATION COMMITTEE, AROUND 30 DEPUTIES, AND MANY MUNICIPAL ADVISORS AND MAYORS.     THE ORGANIZERS OF THE \"DIRTY WAR\" AND THE LEADERS OF THE \"DEATH SQUADS,\" AND OTHER ULTRA-RIGHT-WING FORMATIONS AND THEIR HIRED KILLERS, FEEL THAT THEY CAN GO UNPUNISHED.  THE RESPONSE TO THE TERROR OF THE RIGHT HAS THE ARMED STRUGGLE WHICH HAS CONTINUED FOR MANY YEARS AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM.     IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, VICTIMS OF POLITICAL TERROR ALSO INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE RULING CIRCLES AND THEIR LAW-ENFORCEMENT ORGANS, WAGING AN UNEQUAL STRUGGLE AGAINST THE POWERFUL NARCOTICS MAFIA.  AS A \"SHADOW ECONOMY,\" IT IS TRYING TO BECOME PART OF THE STATE STRUCTURE.  IN THE PAST YEAR THE NARCOTICS BUSINESS HAS \"ENRICHED\" THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY WITH $2 BILLION AND EVEN PROPOSED THAT IT WOULD PAY OFF THE GIGANTIC FOREIGN DEBT.  THE NARCOTICS MAFIA CARRIES OUT REPRISALS AGAINST ITS OPPONENTS.  THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE, A MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT, A DIRECTOR OF THE BIGGEST NEWSPAPER ESPECTADOR, AND, A FEW DAYS AGO, ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR, GOVERNOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTIOQUIA WERE KILLED.  MANY PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES ARE LEAVING THE COUNTRY THROUGH FEAR FOR THEIR OWN LIVES AND THOSE OF THEIR RELATIVES.     THE VIOLENCE IS ESCALATING AND THE IMPRESSION IS BEING FORMED THAT CERTAIN FORCES ARE TRYING TO TAKE THE ATTENTION OF THE 30 MILLION STRONG POPULATION OF COLOMBIA AWAY FROM THE URGENT RESOLUTION OF PRESSING SOCIAL PROBLEMS BY DESTABILIZING INTERNAL LIFE.     SOVIET SOCIETY, IN THE NAME OF OBSERVING BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND CHARITY, CONSIDERS THAT OUR CONSCIENCE CANNOT BE RECONCILED WITH THE ORGY OF POLITICAL TERROR OVERWHELMING COLOMBIA.  WE APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC OF THE WORLD TO RAISE THEIR VOICES AGAINST THIS EVIL IN THE NAME OF THE COMMON SOLIDARITY OF MANKIND.  DRASTIC ACTIONS ARE NEEDED PARTICULARLY ON BEHALF OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS.     WE CONSIDER THAT IN COLOMBIA ITSELF, DIALOGUE BETWEEN OPPOSING SIDES THAT ARE TAKING THE STAND OF PATRIOTISM AND POLITICAL REALISM IS NECESSARY.  THE FRUITFULNESS OF NATIONAL DIALOGUE HAS BEEN PROVED IN PRACTICE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS BY MANY COUNTRIES. THE VITAL INTERESTS OF THE TORMENTED COLOMBIAN PEOPLE CALL FOR CIVIL PEACE.",

CRISTIANI BEGINS BY SAYING THAT THIS IS HIS FIRST REPORT TO THE NATION AFTER 50 DAYS AS PRESIDENT.  HE NOTES THAT SINCE HE ASSUMED POWER ON 1 JUNE, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT HAS INCREASED ITS LEVEL OF VIOLENCE AND ITS NUMBER OF \"INDISCRIMINATE KILLINGS.\"  HE SAYS THAT THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS SINCE HE EXPRESSED ON 1 JUNE HIS DESIRE FIND A PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT IN THE COUNTRY.     CRISTIANI SAYS THAT SINCE 1 JUNE HE HAS REPEATEDLY CALLED FOR A PEACE DIALOGUE, ADDING:  \"IN ORDER TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE OF THIS NATURE, IT MUST BE HELD IN TWO PHASES:  NATURALLY, DURING THE FIRST PHASE BOTH SIDES MUST SIT DOWN TO DISCUSS THE MECHANISMS TO DEVELOP THAT DIALOGUE PROCESS, A TIMETABLE FOR THE TALKS, AND THE PLACE WHERE THE TALKS WILL BE HELD.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE FIRST PHASE WILL BE TO DETERMINE HOW THE DIALOGUE PROCESS WILL TAKE PLACE.  THE SECOND PHASE -- ONCE AN AGREEMENT IS REACHED ON HOW THE DIALOGUE WILL BE HELD -- IS WHAT WILL BE DISCUSSED.  IN THAT REGARD, OUR GOVERNMENT HAS NOT SET ANY CONDITIONS.  WE ARE WILLING TO DISCUSS ANY TOPIC, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE MUST FIND SOLUTIONS TO MANY THINGS, AND WE ARE WILLING TO DO SO.  THE ONLY CONDITION WE HAVE DEMANDED FOR THIS DIALOGUE PROCESS IS THAT, ONCE IT BEGINS, IT SHOULD NOT BE INTERRUPTED FOR ANY REASON.  WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WANT PEACE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AND WE CANNOT HOLD TALKS FOR YEARS.  ONCE WE SIT DOWN TO TALK, THAT DIALOGUE SHOULD CONTINUE UNTIL AN OVERALL SOLUTION IS FOUND TO THE CONFLICT.  THAT IS OUR GOVERNMENT'S POSITION, AND WE MAINTAIN THAT POSITION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS THE MOST LOGICAL ONE.\"     TURNING TO ECONOMIC MATTERS, CRISTIANI SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO SOLVE THREE PROBLEMS:  THE FISCAL DEFICIT, INFLATION, AND UNEMPLOYMENT.  HE SAYS THAT AS A FIRST STEP TO BEGIN THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS TO REFORM THE GOVERNMENT'S PRICING POLICY, ADDING:  \"WE MUST PROTECT LOW-INCOME GROUPS, AND FOR THIS REASON WE HAVE ASKED THE ECONOMY MINISTER TO BEGIN A PROCESS AIMED AT ELIMINATING PRICE CONTROLS.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ELIMINATE PRICE CONTROLS ON 230 PRODUCTS WITHOUT HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE MAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC AND THAT WE CAN KEEP STAPLE PRODUCTS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE ECONOMY MINISTRY.\"  HE SAYS THAT PRICE CONTROLS ON STAPLES LIKE BASIC GRAINS, POWDERED MILK, FLOUR, COFFEE, SUGAR, VEGETABLE OIL AND LARD, CEMENT FOR HOUSING, AND OIL BY-PRODUCTS WILL NOT BE ELIMINATED.     REGARDING THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"WE AGREED WITH THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TO DEREGULATE THE DIFFERENTIAL SERVICE. TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE SERVING LOW-INCOME SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION WHILE CHARGING CURRENT FARES, WE WILL ALSO ALLOW THEM TO OFFER THE HIGHER-PRICED SERVICE.  IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHAT KIND OF SERVICE THEY WANT TO USE: WHETHER THEY CONTINUE TO USE THE LOW-PRICED SERVICE OR A BETTER, MORE COMFORTABLE, AND FASTER SERVICE.\"     ON ELECTRICITY RATES, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"WE FEEL THAT ADJUSTMENTS TO ELECTRICITY RATES SHOULD BE APPLIED AS A RESULT OF POWER THAT IS WASTED, THAT IS, BECAUSE IT IS POWER THAT IS BEING CONSUMED BEYOND WHAT IS NEEDED TO LIVE NORMALLY.  THE INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY RATES WILL BE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY IN EACH HOME.  WE BELIEVE THAT WITH THIS INITIAL MEASURE, THE CEL [LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION] SOLVE PROBLEMS.\"     TURNING TO OTHER ECONOMIC MEASURES, CRISTIANI SAYS:  \"WE HAVE TO TAKE SHORT-TERM MEASURES TOO.  IN THIS RESPECT, THE MOST LOGICAL STEP IS TO TAKE MEASURES THAT WILL AFFECT CONSUMPTION AND NOT REVENUES. THUS, WE HAVE ASKED THE FINANCE MINISTER TO TAKE MEASURES RELATED TO TAXES.  HE IS TO CONSOLIDATE TAX PAYMENTS AND ONLY EXEMPT THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BASIC BREAD BASKET ITEMS FROM THE PRESENT 5-PERCENT TAX.  WE HAVE TO START ELIMINATING TAX EXEMPTIONS.  ONLY EXPORTS SHOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF MONETARY INCENTIVE BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING ITS EXPORTS.  THE REST OF THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC SECTORS SHOULD BE TAXED AT THE SAME RATE.\"     CRISTIANI ADDS:  \"WE ARE GOING TO MODIFY THE SYSTEM OF PAYING INCOME TAX.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS BASED ON UNJUST REGULATIONS, ON REVENUES EARNED THE PREVIOUS YEAR THAT DO NOT REFLECT A FIRM'S PRESENT SITUATION.  THUS, WE ARE GOING TO REQUEST THAT INCOME-TAX PAYMENTS BE BASED ON A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRM'S PRESENT SALES; THESE ARE A TRUER AND MORE ACCURATE REFLECTION OF A FIRM'S INCOME.\"     CRISTIANI SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY'S MONETARY POLICY MUST BE AIMED AT INCREASING SAVINGS TO PROMOTE DOMESTIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  HE SAYS THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE INTEREST RECEIVED ON SAVINGS ACCOUNTS IN THE COUNTRY'S BANKS MORE ATTRACTIVE SO THAT CAPITAL DOES NOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY. REGARDING THE COUNTRY'S CURRENCY, CRISTIANI SAYS:  \"WE FEEL THAT CURRENCY VALUE SHOULD BE BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF AND DEMAND FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE.  WE DO NOT THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ARBITRARILY DEVALUE AND FIX AN EXCHANGE RATE ON THE SALVADORAN COLON. EVERYTHING MUST BE BASED ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE OUR COUNTRY MAY HAVE TO PAY OUT FOR IMPORTS, BECAUSE IF WE WERE TO FIX THE RATE AT 10 [COLONES] TO 1 [DOLLAR], THE CENTRAL BANKS STILL WOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH FOREIGN EXCHANGE TO COVER ALL THE IMPORTERS' DEMANDS.\"     FURTHER DETAILS AS AVAILABLE.",

ON THE ONE HAND, AS THE DICTATORSHIP BECAME MORE AND MORE ISOLATED, IT WAS INCREASINGLY CONDEMNED IN INTERNATIONAL FORA AND REPUDIATED BY INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION. ON THE OTHER HAND, AS MORE AND MORE COUNTRIES AND ORGANIZATIONS EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT FOR A FREE CHILE AND GENEROUSLY GRANTED THEIR SOLIDARITY TO OUR CAUSE, OUR ORGANIZATIONS AND DEMOCRATIC PARTIES BECAME INCREASINGLY OPEN TO THE WORLD. THUS, THEY EXPANDED THEIR HORIZONS AND CONTRIBUTED THEIR EXPERIENCES.     2. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE PARTY HAS SUBSTANTIALLY STRENGTHENED ITS INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND ENHANCED ITS VISION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION. IT HAS STRENGTHENED ITS TIES WITH THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLES' REVOLUTIONARY AND DEMOCRATIC CAUSE, AND IT HAS FULLY IMMERSED ITSELF IN THE GREAT DEBATES OF WORLD SOCIALISM. TO THESE DEBATES WE BROUGHT OUR VIEWS ON A PROFOUNDLY RENEWED LEFTIST SOCIALISM COMMITTED TO DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT, AND SOCIAL CHANGE.     3. OUR RELATIONS WITH THE PARTIES THAT MAKE UP THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST [SI] AND WITH THE SI ORGANIZATION ITSELF HAVE BEEN ENRICHED WITHIN THIS CONTEXT. THIS STRENGTHENING OF TIES HAS BEEN THE RESULT OF TWO THINGS. FIRST, IT IS BASED ON THE POSITION THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS PRINCIPLES THE SI HAS UPHELD REGARDING THE CHILEAN SITUATION. IN OCTOBER 1973, A FEW DAYS AFTER THE COUP, SI CHAIRMAN WILLY BRANDT CONDEMNED THE END OF THE CHILEAN DEMOCRACY AND PRESIDENT ALLENDE'S ASSASSINATION AT THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY. AT THE TIME HE ALSO SAID THIS WAS A GREAT STEP BACKWARD FOR THOSE WHO ASPIRED TO ACHIEVE SOCIALISM THROUGH DEMOCRATIC MEANS. SINCE THEN, THE SI HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY MOBILIZED IN FAVOR OF CHILE BY MAKING THE CHILEAN CAUSE AND SALVADOR ALLENDE THE SYMBOLS OF ALL INTERNATIONAL STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY AND CHANGE. IT IS WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK OF INTEREST AND COOPERATION THAT THE VOICE OF CHILEAN SOCIALISM HAS BEEN HEARD AND OUR IDEAS AND PROPOSALS PRAISED.     4. THE SECOND REASON STEMS FROM THE PROCESS OF EXPANSION AND TRANSFORMATION EXPERIENCED BY THE SI IN THE PAST 2 DECADES. THE OVERALL PROCESS OF CHANGE THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE WORLD DURING THIS PERIOD -- THE TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION, THE GROWING INTERDEPENDENCE AMONG NATIONS, EXPANSION OF COMMUNICATIONS, GLOBAL NUCLEAR AND MILITARY PROLIFERATION, THE EMERGENCE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS INTERNATIONAL COUNTERPARTS, THE WORSENING OF EXTREME POVERTY AND INTERNATIONAL INEQUALITIES, THE PROGRESS OF LIBERATION STRUGGLES IN THE THIRD WORLD, INTERNATIONAL AWARENESS OF THE VALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS -- HAS ALSO EFFECTED MAJOR CHANGES IN THE IDEAS AND POSITIONS OF SOCIALIST PARTIES AROUND THE WORLD. IN THIS FRAMEWORK, THE SI HAS EXPANDED ITS OUTLOOK, HAS INCREASINGLY RENEWED ITS IDEAS AND, ABOVE ALL, HAS ACCEPTED PLURALISM WITHIN ITS FOLD AS WELL AS A BROAD INTERNAL DEBATE ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO PROMOTE THE CAUSE OF AN AUTONOMOUS, DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS DEBATE ACQUIRED A DEMOCRATIC, ANTIFASCIST CONTENT AS A RESULT OF THE MAJOR ROLE PLAYED BY SOCIALIST FORCES THAT HAVE ENGAGED IN A LONG ANTIFASCIST STRUGGLE. [CONTINUED]",

WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF THE AGREEMENT REACHED BY THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES?     [AZCONA] WELL, I READ THE AGREEMENT LAST NIGHT AND BELIEVE IT TO BE A STEP FORWARD.  INCIDENTALLY, I READ IT TWICE LAST NIGHT AND IT IS A VERY LONG DOCUMENT.  I AM TALKING ABOUT THE AGREEMENT WITH THE PARTIES THAT ARE TRULY OPPOSITION PARTIES AND NOT THE ONE MADE WITH THE OTHER PARTIES BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT REALLY OPPOSITION PARTIES.     [REPORTER] WHAT I WANTED WAS YOUR OPINION ON THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE CONTRAS FROM HONDURAS.     [AZCONA] OH, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SMALL DOCUMENT THAT MAKES DEMANDS, DEMANDS, AND MORE DEMANDS.  THIS DOCUMENT HAS NO VALUE.     [REPORTER] I MEAN THE DOCUMENT SIGNED WITH THE 21 POLITICAL PARTIES...     [AZCONA, INTERRUPTING] THAT AGREEMENT IS VALUABLE BUT IT DOES NOT MENTION THE CONTRA DEMOBILIZATION.  THE DOCUMENT STATES THAT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT AND THE OPPOSITION PARTIES AGREE THAT THE ESQUIPULAS II AND COSTA DEL SOL AGREEMENTS SHOULD BE ABIDED BY.  THIS IS THE DOCUMENT I READ TWICE, AND I BELIEVE IT IS QUITE SERIOUS AND A STEP FORWARD.     [REPORTER] WHAT WILL YOU DO TO GET THE MERCENARIES TO LEAVE YOUR COUNTRY?     [AZCONA] FIRST, I DO NOT USE DEROGATORY TERMS.  THEY ARE NICARAGUANS WHO FOR DIFFERENT REASONS DISAGREE WITH THE SYSTEM IN NICARAGUA.  THESE NICARAGUANS OPPOSE THE SYSTEM, AND FOR THIS AND OTHER REASONS THEY HAVE TAKEN UP ARMS AGAINST THE SYSTEM AND HAVE TAKEN REFUGE IN HONDURAS.  I DO NOT USE THE TERM MERCENARY.  I UNDERSTAND THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT USES IT AND IT IS ALL RIGHT FOR THEM TO DO SO, BUT I WILL NOT ANSWER A QUESTION THAT USES A TERM THAT I BELIEVE IS TOO DEROGATORY.     [REPORTER] THE DEMOBILIZATION PLAN HAS A VERY FIRM DEADLINE AND IS TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN 90 DAYS.  DO YOU THINK...     [AZCONA, INTERRUPTING] NO, NO.  THE 90-DAY DEADLINE IS INCLUDED IN AN AGREEMENT SIGNED BY NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT ORTEGA WITH THREE SMALL NICARAGUAN LEFTIST PARTIES.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS DOCUMENT IS VERY IMPORTANT.  I DO BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THE AGREEMENT SIGNED BY THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT AND THE OPPOSITION PARTIES IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON THE ESQUIPULAS II AND COSTA DEL SOL AGREEMENTS.  [WORDS INDISTINCT] TERRORISTS IN EL SALVADOR AND CONTRAS ARE PRESENTLY NOT ACTIVE, SO BOTH SITUATIONS -- CONTRAS AND GUERRILLAS -- ARE DIFFERENT.     [REPORTER] IS IT TRUE THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI IS GOING TO PRESENT A PARALLEL PROGRAM AT THE SUMMIT?     [AZCONA] [WORDS INDISTINCT] PRESIDENT CRISTIANI COMES TO THE SUMMIT AS EL SALVADOR'S LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT.  HE HAS THE RIGHT TO PRESENT HIS POINTS OF VIEW.  HE HAS THE RIGHT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS IN OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL AS TO ONES IN HIS OWN COUNTRY.     [REPORTER] IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT A DEMOBILIZATION PLAN FOR THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS WILL BE STUDIED AT THIS SUMMIT IF PRESIDENT CRISTINAI PRESENTS ONE?     [AZCONA] OF COURSE.  HE HAS A RIGHT TO DO SO.  [CONTINUED]",

THIS HAPPENED ONLY HOURS AFTER COLONEL [ADOLFO ARNOLDO] MAJANO'S BODYGUARDS WERE MURDERED.     THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THIS INCIDENT RAISE SEVERAL QUESTIONS. WHAT WERE THESE TWO SOLDIERS DOING AT 0100? WHERE WERE GOLCHER'S BODYGUARDS? WHERE WERE HIS COMPANION'S BODYGUARDS?

POWERFUL FORCES ARE TRYING TO JUSTIFY VIOLENCE AND WAR EVERY TIME DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS OR COMMITMENTS ARE NOT FOLLOWED OR MET.     WHEN THERE IS AN ARMED STRUGGLE AND WHEN THOUSANDS ARE KILLED ON THE BATTLEFIELD, THOSE WHO PROMOTE VIOLENCE NEVER CONCLUDE FROM THOSE USELESS KILLINGS THAT WAR IS FUTILE. THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT PEACE CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION.     IT WILL ALWAYS BE EASIER TO RECTIFY MISTAKES WHEN THE WEAKNESSES ARE POLITICAL OR WHEN ERRORS ARE MADE ON THE ROAD TO PEACE. WE CANNOT BRING THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE, AND VIOLENCE BORN OF HATRED TAKES A LONG TIME TO HEAL.     I BELIEVE, MR PRESIDENT, THAT IT WOULD BE ENCOURAGING IF YOU WERE TO RECTIFY SOME POLITICAL DECISIONS YOUR GOVERNMENT MADE FOLLOWING THE UNFORTUNATE INCIDENTS AT NANDAIME.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO REOPEN THE COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA THAT ARE CLOSED. IT IS NECESSARY TO RELEASE THE PRISONERS AND TO REVOKE THE SENTENCES IMPOSED UPON THEM AS PUNISHMENT FOR INVOLVEMENT IN THOSE INCIDENTS.  THE PEACE PLAN TO WHICH WE ARE COMMITTED OBLIGES US TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. OUR MOST SACRED COMMITMENT IS TO CONTINUE PROGRESSING ON THE PATH TOWARD DEMOCRATIZATION.     IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT AND THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS RESUME NEGOTIATIONS TO SECURE A PERMANENT END TO MILITARY ACTIONS IN NICARAGUA. THIS COULD VERY WELL BE AN ENCOURAGING EXAMPLE FOR MANY CENTRAL AMERICAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES. I OFFER YOU OUR COSTA RICAN TERRITORY FOR THE RESUMPTION OF SUCH NEGOTIATIONS. I ALSO OFFER YOU ALL THE ASSISTANCE WITHIN MY MEANS TO ENABLE SUCH NEGOTIATIONS TO TAKE PLACE.     I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WILL ATTEND THE UPCOMING INAUGURAL CEREMONY IN ECUADOR. I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE A SIGN OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE OF PEACE, A NOBLE GESTURE TOWARD RODRIGO BORJA, AND WOULD AID IN STRENGTHENING THE ECUADORAN DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IF YOU ATTENDED THE CEREMONY IN QUITO AFTER REVERSING THE SETBACKS INCURRED AS A RESULT OF ANTIDEMOCRATIC ACTIONS, SUCH AS PENALIZING THE COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA AND DEPRIVING MEN AND WOMEN OF THEIR LIBERTY.     ONLY IF WE HAVE THE STRENGTH TO CORRECT OUR MISTAKES AND THE VISION TO CONTINUE ON THE PATH OUTLINED IN THE PEACE PLAN CAN CENTRAL AMERICANS PREVENT THE CONTINUANCE OF THE ARMED AGGRESSION AGAINST OUR PEOPLES. A LATIN AMERICAN COMMITMENT TO PEACE ALSO REQUIRES EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE INDEPENDENCE AND DEMOCRACY. WE WILL NOT BE GRANTED ANOTHER POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY TO FORGE HISTORY. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE A NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR RECONCILIATION TO ALLOW TODAY'S YOUTH A DIFFERENT FUTURE, A NEW OPPORTUNITY TO PUT ASIDE THEIR WEAPONS AND TO WORK FOR A BETTER FUTURE.",

THE PURPOSE OF THIS PLAN WAS TO PRESSURE GENERAL NORIEGA TO RESIGN FROM HIS MILITARY POST IN LATE AUGUST.     THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OBJECTIVES OF THIS PLAN WERE: TO INTENSIFY AND SPREAD THE REPUDIATION OF NORIEGA WITHIN THE FDP; TO INTENSIFY AND SPREAD THE REPUDIATION OF NORIEGA'S COLLABORATORS BY MENTIONING SPECIFIC NAMES; TO CONVINCE NORIEGA THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE NORIEGA'S PANAMANIAN COLLABORATORS THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND NORIEGA ALLIES, PARTICULARLY CUBA AND NICARAGUA, THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE GOVERNMENTS THAT WERE HOSTILE TO NORIEGA, ESPECIALLY VENEZUELA AND COLOMBIA, THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; TO CONVINCE FOREIGN REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS THAT DEALT WITH NORIEGA, SUCH AS THE FMLN AND THE M-19, THAT HE HAD LOST FDP SUPPORT AND THAT HIS REGIME WAS UNSUSTAINABLE; AND TO MOVE THE ANTI-NORIEGA SECTOR WITHIN THE FDP TO SUPPORT SPECIFIC ACTIONS AGAINST NORIEGA'S REGIME.     THE FDP MEMBERS, OFFICERS, AND TROOPS WERE THE TARGETS OF THIS PLAN.  WE SEE HOW SOME WERE TAKEN IN BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS PLAN.  THE TARGETS OF THIS PLAN WERE GEN NORIEGA, NORIEGA'S PANAMANIAN COLLABORATORS WITHIN THE FDP, SOME CIVILIANS, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE NORIEGA'S ALLIES, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE HOSTILE TO NORIEGA, AND FOREIGN REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATIONS THAT DEAL WITH NORIEGA. THEY IDENTIFIED ALL OF NORIEGA'S VULNERABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE VULNERABILITIES OF ALL THE TARGETS WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED.     THERE WERE CERTAIN THEMES USED IN THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS, AND THE MEDIA FELL FOR THEM MANY TIMES. THIS IS WHY WE REPEATEDLY ASKED THEM NOT TO FALL FOR THIS MISINFORMATION.     THESE THEMES INCLUDED: BY IMPOSING HIS ARBITRARY NATURE AND CORRUPTION, NORIEGA IS PERVERTING THE FDP AND PROMOTING THE DISINTEGRATION OF THAT MILITARY INSTITUTION.  THE FDP HAVE BECOME A MAFIA THAT IS HEADING TOWARD DISGRACE. THIS IS A TOPIC THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN LEAFLETS AND MANY PUBLICATIONS.     BY DISRUPTING THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AT HIS WHIM, NORIEGA IS PROVOKING A PROFOUND SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL CRISIS THAT IS RUINING THE COUNTRY. THIS IS DONE TO HIDE THOSE WHO ARE TRULY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRISIS WE ARE EXPERIENCING. THE LONGER NORIEGA REMAINS IN POWER, THE MORE PROBABLE BECOMES A U.S., CUBAN, OR SOVIET INTERVENTION.  THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS PROVOKED BY NORIEGA NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PERSONAL WELL-BEING OF THE FDP MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES.     NORIEGA'S FALL IS INEVITABLE AND THE FDP SHOULD NOT FALL WITH HIM. TO SAVE THE FDP AND THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA, THE FDP MUST REMOVE NORIEGA FROM OFFICE. THIS IS WHY THERE WERE SIREN SONGS THAT AN INTERNAL COUP WAS UNDER WAY.     THE STATE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS CASE FOR 5 MONTHS AND WE KNOW THE FUGITIVES ARE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE KNOW WHERE THEY LEFT FROM. NO ONE CAN DENY THE ASSOCIATION OF CERTAIN U.S. CITIZENS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THIS OPERATION WITH THE PANAMANIAN GROUPS THAT WERE CAPTURED.     WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE, THE WEAPONS, THE INSTRUMENTS USED FOR MISINFORMATION, THE PLANS, AND THE MAPS WITH THE TARGETS FOR VIOLENCE. IMPORTANT PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO BE KIDNAPPED HAD ALSO BEEN MARKED ON THESE MAPS. THEY HAD MARKED THE BRIDGES THAT WERE TO BE DESTROYED.     GENTLEMEN, WE KNOW THE POWER OF WEAPONS AND WE KNOW HOW TO USE THEM.  WE KNOW THE DAMAGE THEY CAN DO. THEREFORE, BEFORE THERE WAS A VIOLENT CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE AND THEIR FDP, WE WENT ONE STEP AHEAD OF THEIR PLANS. IF ARRESTS WERE MADE, IT WAS BECAUSE WE WANTED TO AVOID A CONFRONTATION WITH INEXPERIENCED GROUPS THAT ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE USED FOR THE PERSONAL BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO RECEIVED, WITH A SIREN SONG, THE PROMISE OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE'S $30 MILLION THAT ERIC ARTURO DELVALLE WAS GOING TO USE FOR SUBVERSIVE ACTS, BLOODY ACTS TO BATHE OUR PEOPLE IN BLOOD, AS IN THE CASE OF THE STRUGGLE OF OUR BROTHER COUNTRIES IN LATIN AND CENTRAL AMERICA.     WE WILL NOT PERMIT THAT. THAT IS WHY WE DECIDED TO GO ONE STEP AHEAD AND FOIL THESE PLANS THAT HAVE A CERTAIN PURPOSE AND THAT WOULD RESULT IN MOURNING AND PAIN FOR PANAMANIAN FAMILIES.     WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE AND THOSE WHO WERE ARRESTED WERE DAMN WELL ARRESTED: ALBERTO CONTE, FRED BOYD, AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES SO EDUARDO HERRERA AND FRIENDS CAN LIVE LIKE KINGS IN THE UNITED STATETS, SO THEY CAN LIVE THEIR LIVES DRINKING CHAMPAGNE AND EATING PHEASANT.     EDUARDO HERRERA WAS DISMISSED FROM A DIPLOMATIC POST FOR SMUGGLING 40 BOXES OF WHISKEY PER WEEK INTO ISRAEL.  HE IS THE KIND OF PERSON PROTECTED BY THE PENTAGON AND ELLIOTT ABRAMS. HE IS ELLIOTT ABRAMS' HERO.     THERESA WELLINGTON OF THE [U.S.] EMBASSY IN MEXICO, WHO GAVE THESE PEOPLE--WHO LEFT PANAMA FOR MEXICO-- THEIR VISAS IN 10 MINUTES BY ABRAMS' ORDERS, HAS ALSO BECOME ONE OF OUR PEOPLE'S ENEMIES.
