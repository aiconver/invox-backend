WE HAVE TO SAY FIRST THAT THE PRESIDENTS OF EL SALVADOR AND COSTA RICA, AND PROBABLY OF GUATEMALA, HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT PRIOR TO THE MEETING.  THE SUBJECT OF THE DISCUSSION WAS A DOCUMENT DRAFTED BY ARIAS AND CEREZO.  THIS DOCUMENT EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR CRISTIANI FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. JOSEPH SULLIVAN, A U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL IN CHARGE OF LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS, AS WELL AS OTHER U.S.  STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS, WERE PRESENT AT THE MEETING.  THE COSTA RICAN AMBASSADOR TO NICARAGUA -- A PRO-U.S. MAN WHO INTRODUCED THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS AT THE MEETING -- WAS ALSO PRESENT, CONSPIRING ALL THE TIME.

HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE MEETING HAD BEEN FIXED AND IN SPITE OF THE U.S. PRESENCE, THE AGREEMENT TO SUPPORT CRISTIANI WAS ACHIEVED ALMOST AT THE PRICE OF KILLING THE ESQUIPULAS AGREEMENT.  IT WAS NOT EASY.  THE U.S. WILL TO CONDEMN THE FMLN AND TO BACK CRISTIANI PREVAILED IN THE MIDST OF MUCH BICKERING AND THE INSOLENCE OF THE HONDURAN PRESIDENT.

THE COMMUNIQUE SAYS THAT TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS THE MIR WILL PROMOTE A TACTIC \"TO DESTABILIZE THE REGIME, TO MAKE THE INSTITUTIONS ILLEGITIMATE, TO DEMOCRATIZE THE COUNTRY, AND TO ACCUMULATE GREATER FORCE.\"     THE COMMUNIQUE ALSO POINTS OUT THAT THE MIR WILL USE \"THE LIMITED POSSIBILITY OF PARTICIPATING IN ELECTIONS BEGINNING IN 1988.\" THIS IS WHY THE MIR SUPPORTS THE REGISTRATION OF A LEFTIST PARTY: TO PREVENT THE EXCLUSION OF THE LEFT AND \"TO PROMOTE THE GAINS OF THE PEOPLE.\""

THE ORGANIZERS OF THE \"DIRTY WAR\" AND THE LEADERS OF THE \"DEATH SQUADS,\" AND OTHER ULTRA-RIGHT-WING FORMATIONS AND THEIR HIRED KILLERS, FEEL THAT THEY CAN GO UNPUNISHED.  THE RESPONSE TO THE TERROR OF THE RIGHT HAS THE ARMED STRUGGLE WHICH HAS CONTINUED FOR MANY YEARS AND LEFT-WING EXTREMISM.     IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, VICTIMS OF POLITICAL TERROR ALSO INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE RULING CIRCLES AND THEIR LAW-ENFORCEMENT ORGANS, WAGING AN UNEQUAL STRUGGLE AGAINST THE POWERFUL NARCOTICS MAFIA.  AS A \"SHADOW ECONOMY,\" IT IS TRYING TO BECOME PART OF THE STATE STRUCTURE.  IN THE PAST YEAR THE NARCOTICS BUSINESS HAS \"ENRICHED\" THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY WITH $2 BILLION AND EVEN PROPOSED THAT IT WOULD PAY OFF THE GIGANTIC FOREIGN DEBT.  THE NARCOTICS MAFIA CARRIES OUT REPRISALS AGAINST ITS OPPONENTS.  THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE, A MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT, A DIRECTOR OF THE BIGGEST NEWSPAPER ESPECTADOR, AND, A FEW DAYS AGO, ANTONIO ROLDAN BETANCUR, GOVERNOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTIOQUIA WERE KILLED.  MANY PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES ARE LEAVING THE COUNTRY THROUGH FEAR FOR THEIR OWN LIVES AND THOSE OF THEIR RELATIVES.     THE VIOLENCE IS ESCALATING AND THE IMPRESSION IS BEING FORMED THAT CERTAIN FORCES ARE TRYING TO TAKE THE ATTENTION OF THE 30 MILLION STRONG POPULATION OF COLOMBIA AWAY FROM THE URGENT RESOLUTION OF PRESSING SOCIAL PROBLEMS BY DESTABILIZING INTERNAL LIFE.     SOVIET SOCIETY, IN THE NAME OF OBSERVING BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND CHARITY, CONSIDERS THAT OUR CONSCIENCE CANNOT BE RECONCILED WITH THE ORGY OF POLITICAL TERROR OVERWHELMING COLOMBIA.  WE APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC OF THE WORLD TO RAISE THEIR VOICES AGAINST THIS EVIL IN THE NAME OF THE COMMON SOLIDARITY OF MANKIND.  DRASTIC ACTIONS ARE NEEDED PARTICULARLY ON BEHALF OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS.     WE CONSIDER THAT IN COLOMBIA ITSELF, DIALOGUE BETWEEN OPPOSING SIDES THAT ARE TAKING THE STAND OF PATRIOTISM AND POLITICAL REALISM IS NECESSARY.  THE FRUITFULNESS OF NATIONAL DIALOGUE HAS BEEN PROVED IN PRACTICE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS BY MANY COUNTRIES. THE VITAL INTERESTS OF THE TORMENTED COLOMBIAN PEOPLE CALL FOR CIVIL PEACE."

THIS IS, HOWEVER, A CRITICAL MOMENT FOR THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT, AND HE KNOWS IT.  BUT THIS POINT WAS ALSO STRESSED BY THE LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO BOOED HIM AT NEARLY EVERY LARGE U.S.  CITY HE VISITED.  ALTHOUGH THE GHOSTS OF THE ASSASSINATED JESUITS SHADOWED HIM ALL DURING HIS TOUR, THE ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] REPRESENTATIVE, JUST AS HIS PREDECESSOR JOSE NAPOLEON DUARTE DID, FLEW TO THE UNITED STATES TO TRY TO CONVINCE THE LEGISLATORS, PARTICULARLY THE DEMOCRATS, THAT HE INTENDS TO RESUME THE DIALOGUE FOR PEACE AND CHECK THE ARMY'S CRIMINAL ASPIRATIONS.  WAVING THE HUMAN RIGHTS FLAG HAS BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR CRISTIANI, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE HE IS AWARE THAT WITH THIS ACTION HE CAN CONTINUE TO RECEIVE WASHINGTON'S FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR HIS GOVERNMENT.     ACCORDING TO TO SOME EXPERTS, CRISTIANI WENT FARTHER THAN HIS PREDECESSOR.  HE ASKED THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO HELP IN THE RESUMPTION OF TALKS WITH THE GUERRILLAS, REPLACED SEVERAL MILITARY OFFICERS OF DOUBTFUL REPUTATION, AND ASSURED HE WILL PUNISH SEVERELY EIGHT SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF ASSASSINATING THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS.  WE MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT, PRIOR TO HIS TRIP, THE SALVADORAN PRESIDENT SUCCEEDED IN CURBING A COUP ATTEMPT STAGED BY ARMY REACTIONARY GROUPS. MEMBERS OF THE SALVADORAN OPPOSITION HAVE COINCIDED IN THER VIEW THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD A HEAD OF STATE CHALLENGED THE MILITARY HIERARCHY TO SUCH AN EXTENT, A HIERARCHY THAT OPPOSES ALL NEGOTIATION WITH THE GUERRILLAS.  THE EXPERTS ALSO SAID, HOWEVER, THAT THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL SITUATION HAS NEVER BEEN SO SERIOUS.     THE REBEL OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED IN NOVEMBER IS A LANDMARK, AFTER WHICH EVERYTHING WILL BE DIFFERENT IN EL SALVADOR, BEGINNING WITH THE GOVERNMENT PARTY, WHICH WAS LEFT IN A VERY DELICATE SITUATION IN THE EYES OF INFLUENTIAL U.S. POWER CIRCLES.  THE GUERRILLA DRIVE ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT ONLY TWO ALTERNATIVES ARE LEFT FOR THE COUNTRY.  IF SERIOUS PEACE NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOT INITIATED, THE COUNTERINSURGENCY POLICY WILL BE AGGRAVATED. THIS COULD EVEN GIVE THE UNITED STATES A PRETEXT TO INTERVENE DIRECTLY IN THE COUNTRY.     ALTHOUGH PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH SAID HE WOULD CONTINUE TO AID EL SALVADOR, A LARGE NUMBER OF LEGISLATORS FOR A LONG TIME HAVE BEEN QUESTIONING WHAT USE HAS BEEN NEARLY $4 BILLION DELIVERED TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY IN 10 YEARS OF WAR.  IF FOR THE WHITE HOUSE THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO CONTINUE TO GIVE MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR OR RESIGN ITSELF TO AN EVENTUAL VICTORY OF THE REBELS, FOR CRISTIANI THE SITUATION IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE, TO GET MORE MONEY, HE MUST ENSURE THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED.  THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO INFLUENCING THE MOST REACTIONARY MILITARY OFFICERS AND GUARANTEEING THE FULFILLMENT OF THE FAMOUS ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN ADVOCATED BY HIS PARTY.  THESE POINTS ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLY WITH IN A COUNTRY IMMERSED IN WAR.  IF THE ECONOMY IS WEAK, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IS EVEN WEAKER.  ANYWAY, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS PLANNING TO INCREASE AID FOR THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.  THIS CONTRIBUTES TO PUTTING FAR INTO THE DISTANCE ANY PLANS TO END THE WAR."

[BARCO] I DO NOT BELIEVE YOUR QUESTION IS RELEVANT TO THE COMPOSITION AND PURPOSE OF THE GROUP OF EIGHT MEETING.  THE QUESTION ARISES FROM A LACK OF INFORMATION. COLOMBIA IS A DEMOCRACY, SUPPORTED BY A PROFESSIONAL ARMED FORCES.  THE SOLDIERS ARE COLOMBIANS WHO ARE COMPLYING WITH THE REQUIREMENT TO PERFORM MILITARY SERVICE. THEY ARE YOUTHS FROM ALL GROUPS, FROM THE RURAL AREAS, THE CITIES, AND FROM ALL POLITICAL PARTIES. THE OFFICERS ARE PROFESSIONALS, AND THEY DO NOT FOLLOW MILITARIST DOCTRINES.

THE EMPHASIS WAS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER.     WHAT WAS NOT MADE PUBLIC WAS THAT THE POLITICAL VOTE OF \"THE MORE THAN 50 AND FEWER THAN 100 PARTICIPANTS\" SPOKE OF GIVING PRIORITY TO SOCIALIST LEADERSHIP IN THE NEW PARTY.

THE REPRESENTATIVES OF OUR LOCAL SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENTS HAVE SAID ABROAD THAT THERE IS REPRESSION IN EL SALVADOR.  ONLY A GOVERNMENT THAT IMPOSES ITSELF BY FORCE ON ITS PEOPLE CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A REPRESSIVE GOVERNMENT. OUR COUNTRY NEVER ENJOYED SO MUCH FREEDOM AS NOW AND ITS RULERS WERE NEVER CHOSEN SO FREELY AS THEY ARE NOW.

these are a truer and more accurate reflection of a firm's income.\" cristiani says that the country's monetary policy must be aimed at increasing savings to promote domestic economic development. like he says that it is necessary to make interest received on savings accounts in the country's banks more attractive so that capital does not leave the country. regarding the country's currency cristiani says: \"we feel that currency value should be based on the availability of and demand for foreign exchange. uh we do not think it is appropriate for the government to arbitrarily devalue and fix an exchange rate on the salvadoran colon. everything must be based on the foreign exchange our country may have to pay out for imports, because if we were to fix the rate at 10 to 1 , the central banks still would not have enough foreign exchange to cover all the importers' demands.\" further details as available.",

REGARDING THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"WE AGREED WITH THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TO DEREGULATE THE DIFFERENTIAL SERVICE. TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE SERVING LOW-INCOME SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION WHILE CHARGING CURRENT FARES, WE WILL ALSO ALLOW THEM TO OFFER THE HIGHER-PRICED SERVICE.  IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHAT KIND OF SERVICE THEY WANT TO USE: WHETHER THEY CONTINUE TO USE THE LOW-PRICED SERVICE OR A BETTER, MORE COMFORTABLE, AND FASTER SERVICE.\"     ON ELECTRICITY RATES, CRISTIANI SAYS: \"WE FEEL THAT ADJUSTMENTS TO ELECTRICITY RATES SHOULD BE APPLIED AS A RESULT OF POWER THAT IS WASTED, THAT IS, BECAUSE IT IS POWER THAT IS BEING CONSUMED BEYOND WHAT IS NEEDED TO LIVE NORMALLY.  THE INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY RATES WILL BE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY IN EACH HOME.  WE BELIEVE THAT WITH THIS INITIAL MEASURE, THE CEL [LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION] SOLVE PROBLEMS.\"     TURNING TO OTHER ECONOMIC MEASURES, CRISTIANI SAYS:  \"WE HAVE TO TAKE SHORT-TERM MEASURES TOO.  IN THIS RESPECT, THE MOST LOGICAL STEP IS TO TAKE MEASURES THAT WILL AFFECT CONSUMPTION AND NOT REVENUES. THUS, WE HAVE ASKED THE FINANCE MINISTER TO TAKE MEASURES RELATED TO TAXES.  HE IS TO CONSOLIDATE TAX PAYMENTS AND ONLY EXEMPT THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BASIC BREAD BASKET ITEMS FROM THE PRESENT 5-PERCENT TAX.  WE HAVE TO START ELIMINATING TAX EXEMPTIONS.  ONLY EXPORTS SHOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF MONETARY INCENTIVE BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING ITS EXPORTS.  THE REST OF THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC SECTORS SHOULD BE TAXED AT THE SAME RATE.\"     CRISTIANI ADDS:  \"WE ARE GOING TO MODIFY THE SYSTEM OF PAYING INCOME TAX.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS BASED ON UNJUST REGULATIONS, ON REVENUES EARNED THE PREVIOUS YEAR THAT DO NOT REFLECT A FIRM'S PRESENT SITUATION.  THUS, WE ARE GOING TO REQUEST THAT INCOME-TAX PAYMENTS BE BASED ON A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE FIRM'S PRESENT SALES; THESE ARE A TRUER AND MORE ACCURATE REFLECTION OF A FIRM'S INCOME.\"     CRISTIANI SAYS THAT THE COUNTRY'S MONETARY POLICY MUST BE AIMED AT INCREASING SAVINGS TO PROMOTE DOMESTIC ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  HE SAYS THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE INTEREST RECEIVED ON SAVINGS ACCOUNTS IN THE COUNTRY'S BANKS MORE ATTRACTIVE SO THAT CAPITAL DOES NOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY. REGARDING THE COUNTRY'S CURRENCY, CRISTIANI SAYS:  \"WE FEEL THAT CURRENCY VALUE SHOULD BE BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF AND DEMAND FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE.  WE DO NOT THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ARBITRARILY DEVALUE AND FIX AN EXCHANGE RATE ON THE SALVADORAN COLON. EVERYTHING MUST BE BASED ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE OUR COUNTRY MAY HAVE TO PAY OUT FOR IMPORTS, BECAUSE IF WE WERE TO FIX THE RATE AT 10 [COLONES] TO 1 [DOLLAR], THE CENTRAL BANKS STILL WOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH FOREIGN EXCHANGE TO COVER ALL THE IMPORTERS' DEMANDS.\"     FURTHER DETAILS AS AVAILABLE."
